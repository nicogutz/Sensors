Very small and difficult to
measure with a standard
data acq. system!

First, strain gages are applied in two types of tasks:
• stress analysis of machines,
• for constructions of force, torque and other sensors.
So, the question here is how do we measure such a small resistor
displacement?
Imagine we have a strain gage made of steel of 100 (0.4% resistance) ohms.
We could put the standard measurement system such as for the
potentiometer. This means an excitation voltage of 10 volts, connected to the
SG and another resistance in series (as a voltage divisor). Now we strain the
gage to its maximum, which means a 0.4% increase in resistance. Thus, the
resistance becomes 100.4 ohms, and the voltage is then 5.002 V.
This means that we would need a system able to measure with very very
high accuracy. This is not really possible with standard measuring systems.
Thus, we need different ways of implementation for the strain gages.

How do we measure the small displacement?
The basic principle of the resistance strain gage is implemented in
different ways:
Unbonded metal-wire gage
o
Bonded:
o
• metal-wire gage
• metal-foil gage
• deposited thin-metal-film gage
• semiconductor gage
5
So, we will need more sophisticated manners of measurement for the strain
gage. In fact, we will have two types of implementations: Unbounded or
bounded, where unbounded means that the strain is not fixed to a surface
and bonded means that the structure is glued to a surface, which will perform
the stress.

Let’s talk about the Unbounded metal-wire gage!

Type of strain gages: Unbounded-Definition
4 active resistors in a
Wheatstone bridge
7
In this case, we will have 4 strain gages. How does this work?
When we have an input motion, two of the strings will become longer and the
other two will become shorter.
If we translate it into a circuit, we will have four resistors connected in a
wheatstonebridge structure.
When we pull, 2 of them will increase in resistance and the other two will
decrease.
These increments/decrements will be of the same magnitude because they
are all connected and they are on opposite sides. R1 and R3 take the same
effect, and R2, R4 as well.
This will be one of the systems to calculate small resistances. Why? Let’s try
to do a calculation!

We have the four resistors in the wheatstonebridge. We connect a Vex to
the input and we will have a Vo or output that we can measure, which is the
difference between Vband Va. What is the value of Vo is there is no
elongation? In that case it would be 0, because the difference of voltage is 0.
What happens if we strain the gages. This means that two of the resistors
increase by a deltaRand the other two decrease with the delta R in a full
bridge style (opposites).
If we calculate this, V0 is equal to the excitation multiplied by the relative
increment of Resistance. This is very interesting because as we know this
relative increment is proportional to the length strain. Thus, GF times delta L
over L. Thus, we have three constants. This means, that my output voltage is
nicely proportional to the elongation or change of length.
From here we can obtain the sensitivity of the sensor. The sensitivity would
be output divided by input.
How do we increase the sensitivity of my sensor?
• By increasing the excitation voltage. However, this can increase the
temperature, which we would like to avoid
• By increasing the GF, we can choose materials with higher GF.
• Or by decreasing the length. Of course, this could be constant, so not
much we can do about that.

Now, what happens with the temperature?
If the full bridge heats up, all the resistors will increase temperature in the
same way.
Does it affect the output voltage?
We can call the temperature coefficient alpha, and multiply by the resistors.
This factor will affect in the same manner numerator and denominator, which
means that they cancel each-other and we can say that it will not have much
effect on the output voltage.
The reason for this is because we use relative changes. If the effect of the
temperature is on the absolute resistance, both overall as well as the
variation get affected in the same way, and we can conclude there is no big
effect of the temperature on this system.
9
Type of Strain Gages: Unbounded – attached
10
However, the structure that we have seen so far, is not very stable or robust
as the stress needs to happen per strain. It would be easier to still have the
same type of characteristics but attached to an structure.
This is what we see in the second figure. In it, we have a bar which is
stretched, and the strain gage is attached to the side of the bar and is
strained with it. In this way, the structure is a bit more rigid. In this figure we
can also introduce a new definition or microstrain. As we have already seen
that the strains that we are going to have with strain gages are very very
small. As such, we would need to always play with very small numbers. To
avoid this we define the microstrain, where a microstrainis defined as 10-6
cm/cm.
10
Type of Strain gages: Unbounded - Properties
• Pro:
• Linear behavior in elastic region (ideal)
• Small temp coefficient
• Excitation: AC or DC
• Accurate (1% or better)
• Small displacement
• Cons:
• Small Gage Factor: GF = 2 to 4
• Sensible to shock
• Critical mechanic structure
11
What are the properties of these unbounded strain gages?
We will have a linear behavior in the elastic region.
It has a small temperature coefficient.
On the resistance itself, we can compensate with the bridge as we already
saw today.
For the GF it is a very small number.
It can be excited with AC and DC.
It is very accurate and for very small displacements.
However, it has a small GF.
It is sensible to shock because it is unbounded, it can lead to oscilationsand
errors.
11
How do we measure the small displacement?
The basic principle of the resistance strain gage is implemented in
different ways:
Unbonded metal-wire gage

13
In order to improve some of the disadvantages of the unbounded strain
gages, we can “bond” them to the structures.
For instances, in the first example this means to glue it to the structure.
We take the wire and we glue it on a support. It is very easy to make.
However, it has a very big issue:
In most of the cases, we will want to measure a displacement in one
direction (the direction of the force). Most of the wire is stretched in that
direction. Something like 90%. However, we will have also sensitivity in the
perpendicular direction. This is unwanted. Thus, we have high transverse
sensitivity.
Only 90% of the resistance of the wire is stretched in the right direction. The
10% (more or less) is in the other direction. This is not good, except for
cases in which we do not need a very high accuracy.

The next bonded strain gage gives us a better result
14
Type of strain gages: Bonded metal foil (1)
Properties:
Fat end turns • 120to1000Ω
• 0,001mm thick
• 1% accuracy
• Max strain: 0,5 to4%
• Special cases up to10%
• Pro:
• Small Transverse sensitivity
• Small shock sensitivity
• AC-and DC-supply
• Robust
• Con:
• Small sensitivity GF≈ 2
• Small temp range T<70°C
(creep)
15
These are ready made, the strain gage is already set into a foil and this foil
can be glued into the support. This is much easier to work with.
The total resistance can be between 100 and 1000 ohms.
They are very verythin and this is very good.
The thinner, the closer the metal foil is on the bar. This is good as later on,
when we stretch the bar, we want the foil to have the same strain as the bar.
Accuracy is again very good. The max strain depends on the manufacturer
and the use. Imagine you buy a foil with a max strain lower than the one of
the bar, this means, we will go over the max strain, thus it would break. Thus,
we need to buy a foil with a strain which is bigger than the one of the support
material. The range should be bigger.
What about the transverse sensitivity? This is solved by the fat end turns
(1% vs 99%). This is something similar of what was happening with the eddy
currents in actuators (by doing the fat ending, we reduce the transverse
sensitivity).
However, again it has a small GF (sensitivity) of around 2. And a small
temperature range. This is not only due to the strain gage but mostly due to
the glue. The glue is the weakest link. If the glue starts to “melt”, it will start
creeping.
This type of system is mostly used for force and pressure sensors as we will
see later on.
15
Type of strain gages: Bonded metal foil (2)
16
Bonded metal foils are actually sold in a plethora of shapes and sizes. The
first one could be used for torque measurements (angular velocity). The third
one measures bi directional elongations, it could be used on a membrane for
instance.

Or as we can see it there in a spring.

18
Another one!
18
Types of strain gages: deposited thin metal film
• Strain gage is evaporated or sputtered.
• As a result, the strain gage will be a part of his carrier: better properties.
• Properties:
Pro:
o
• very accurate, reproducible, less temperature dependent
• A good choice of membrane of another carrier and gage material.
• Thin layer gage with big surface : so good heath flow.
• Direct contact: no glue
• Higher sensitivity by trimming with lasers
• Linearity, hysteresis and stability are only dependent of the carrier.
Con:
o
• Small output signal GF=2
• Very expensive, only for mass production
19
More professional or industrial strain gages.
Sometimes, if we would need to make 1000 or 10.000 of these strain gages
on every bar, it is not very efficient.
The solution is to directly evaporate or sputter the strain gage directly onto
the bar.
In that case, the bar (or part of the bar where the strain gage is sputtered)
needs to be isolated from electricity as not to provoke a short circuit. One
clear example is aluminium, which is a very good conductor, but aluminium
oxide is a very good insulator. This means we could have a bar with a
coating of aluminium, scratch the surface, let it oxidate and place the strain
gage on it.
What is very good about this system?
First, it works very well as a temperature conductor, as it is connected within
the bar, the temperature gets dissipated in it.
Moreover, it can be trimmed with a laser to make the bridge electrically
balanced
It is linear, same as before
On the negative side:
It has still a very small Gage Factor
And well, the production is very expensive, so it is only made for mass
production, not for small ones.

20
The final type of strain gages that we are going to discuss are the semi
conductors or piezo-resistive materials, with a very high GF.
20
Type of strain gages: Semiconductor (1)
Piezo-resistive:
p-type silicium
A semiconductor can be used as carrier or a
semiconductor of an opposite type can be diffused
21
What were piezo-resistive strain gages?
These are SG where when we have an elongation or displacement, it is not
about the length or the area, but the weight is on the resistivity (the structure
inside).
If you remember from the table of last Friday, one of the best piezo resistive
materials where the semiconductors made out of silicon, where they can be
either n or p type. These are very nice to make, they can be integrated on an
integrated circuit and they have a very high GF. This means that they make
very good measurement systems, not because they become longer or
shorter but because if we pull on them, the resistivity of the material
changes. We will not use them like this, but more integrated in a circuit.
21
Type of strain gages: Semiconductor (2)
• Pro:
Diffused semiconductor gages:
• High sensitivity GF>100
• Very good accuracy
• Predictable TC
• Small mass so high normal
frequency
• Small dimensions: miniature
sensors possible
• Very good stability
• Con:
• Small temp range T<120°C
• Very big TC
22
We will use it more like this. It looks a bit like a diode.
We will have p-silicon and n-silicon, where the inner layer or p-type silicon
will be the strain gage, which will be insulated by an n-type silicon. We will
connect the p-type to a power supply, and by stretching the material, we get
the change in elongation.
Why are these so good?
First, they have a GF of more than 100 (or -100 if we have p-type). These
can be very easily combined
They have a very high temperature coefficient, but this can be compensated,
with bridges for example. If it cannot be compensated, it can always be
predicted within the chip. It can be measured and controlled.
It can be made very verysmall (IMEC has made their whole business about
semiconductors)
On the negative side,
They have a small temperature range.

24
How do we start with such an exercise?
First, the simplest manner is to put it on a bridge. In it we will have three
dummy resistors, to which in order to have them in equilibrium we give them
also the value of 120 Ohm.
Then, we can calculate the excitation voltage. We have the excitation current
that will go both through the upper resistor and the SG. Thus, we can
calculate the Vexcitationas 240 times maximum excitation current.
Now the strain is the stress divided by Young’s modulus (The Young's modulus
(E) isa property of the material that tells us how easily it can stretch and deform
and is defined as the ratio of tensile stress (σ) to tensile strain (ε)).
Thus, the strain is 33microm/m, which means 33 micro strains.
From the strain and everything else we have, we can actually calculate the
differential of resistance as we know the relation between the GF, the strain
and the relative difference of R. This gives a maximum variation of
resistance of 8.4 mOhm. This is very verysmall. We have a bar with a
resistor of 120 Ohm, we put 70 Kg on the bar and the resistor varies 8.4
mOhm. This cannot be measured with the Multimeter.
Now, for the given bridge with one active element, we can approximate the
V0 as the Vex multiplied by dRover 4R. This gives us 130 microvolt, which is
very small but not too small. If we make an amplifier that amplifies 1000
times (with an OA), we could already have 130 mV which is a value that can
be easily measured by any data acquisition system. Thus, we only need to
add an Operational amplifier which amplifies that signal.
24
Is this the only problem? No, the big issue is actually the noise, which is
there due to the environment, the temperature, etc.
24
Exercise – SNR?
• On steel rod: 1 cm2 (E = 210 GPa)

(cid:2868) • Stress σ: 700 N/cm2 (70 Kg/ cm2)
• GF: 2
Thermal or Johnson-noise generated in every resistance: • 120 Ω
• Max I exec = 30 mA
𝑉 = 4𝑘𝑇𝑅Δ𝑓 =0.45 μ𝑉
(cid:3041)
• Temp around 20°C
(R = 120 Ω at 300 K over a bandwidth of 100KHz)
(cid:2869)(cid:2871)(cid:2868)
Signal to noise ratio 𝑆𝑁𝑅 = =280–This is acceptable
(cid:2868).(cid:2872)(cid:2873)
Suppose now 70g/cm2 instead of 70 Kg/cm2
The signal is then 0.13 μ𝑉 which is less than the noise -> the signal would be lost in the noise.
In practical strain-gage measurement systems, Johnson noise of resistances is the main limit to
the system resolution.
25
In fact, this noise can be modelled as the Johnson noise which is generated
by every resistance (k is the Boltzmann constant). In this case we could
calculate 0.45microvolt. Would this be ok? Yes, because the signal is much
bigger than the noise. We can measure with a resolution more than 1/280 so
that we detect the signal over the noise. This is also very good because we
are aiming at an accuracy of 1% (1/100).
Now suppose that we have 70 g instead of 70Kg. Here, the signal will be
0.13 microvolt (1000 times less). This is less than the noise, therefore the
signal would be lost. Thus, one of the limitations of our systems is the noise.

Special type of strain gages: elastic mercury tube (1)

o Linearity 1% linear to 10% stretch
4% linear to 30% stretch
o For big displacements.
o Pro:
• Sensible for small forces
o Con:
• Small LINEAR range
• Difficult calibration
• Permanent stretch on long term
• Very small temp range
26
Finally, we can discuss a special type of strain gage, the elastic mercury
tube. Mercury has been traditionally used because it is a liquid conductor.
However, nowadays this is forbidden in healthcare as mercury is poisonous.
It is possible to substitute the liquid by salty water to have the same sensor.
A silicon tube is filled in by a liquid conductor and two connector at the side.
We can strain now the silicon tube which is very plastic, so it has a very big
displacement.
Now, what was the GF of a fluid?
There is no piezo resistive effect
And the poissonconstant was 0.5
Thus, the GF of a 2
The problem is that is not very accurate. But, when this system is used, we
do not look for accuracy but the ease to use and it is very cheap.
It is linear, it is difficult to calibrate, but it can be put around your chest.

27
If we put it around the chest, it can help to measure the volume of the lungs
(pletismographic).
What we can use it for? One traditional application was for SIDS (Sudden
Infant Dead Syndrome) detection. SIDS is a “disease” for which babies (until
2 year old) can just suddenly die without any apparent cause. This was very
common in the past, nowadays way less because of a lot of research on how
to avoid it. One of the most common causes for SIDS is that the neuronal
system of the baby is not fully developed and due to that, it “forgets” to
breath (which is an autonomous function). Due to this, babies were dying. To
avoid this, engineers developed a system (completely innocent) made to
detect if the baby was breathing. It is only made to detect if the volume of the
lungs changes. It does not need to be an accurate system, just very easy
and cheap. Parents got this equipment at home, the system was measuring
the volume of the lungs and if it stopped changing for a few seconds, it
meant that the baby was not breathing anymore. Thus, they could just wake
up the baby so that it would start breathing again. Nowadays, it is only used
on very premature babies, which could carry this for a few months, but there
are other techniques (enough air in the room, not smoking around the baby,
temperatures not higher than 20 degrees) but this system can be used in
extreme scenarios.
