Magnetic axes of the three-phases in a 2-pole machine

First of all, in the next slides everything that we will talk about is about what
happens in the stator. We will not consider the rotor.
An AC motor stator is a 3-phase system. Thus, we have three long wires
(windings) through which goes a current (one per phase).
The difference with the DC motors is that these currents (and respective
voltages) will vary sinusoidally. The sinusoids are with the same amplitude
and frequency, but they are dephasedon 120 degrees. Together, they
produce a magnetic field (Ampere’s law) that goes through the air gap to the
rotor.

Goal: rotating magnetic field

Here we can see a representation of what we are talking about. This is a
space vector. It has constant length and it rotates at a certain constant
speed.
Now, how do we interpret the space vector? It represents a rotating magnetic
field. The space vector points in a certain direction in the air gap (space
between rotor and stator) where the magnetic field is the strongest and going
outerward.
If we move away from that position, the magnetic field becomes weaker and
weaker until we reach 90 degrees and at that position it is 0.
Then, it drops further and it goes to negative values (it points inwards). At
180 degrees from that space vector, the magnetic field is again at maximum
but pointing inwards.
In summary, the space vector describes the direction in which the magnetic
field is the strongest, away from that space vector it drops sinusoidally. It will
vary sinusoidally to zero and then negative. This is a very typical behavior on
AC motors.
Now, what is the AC about it? Well, the magnetic field is moving sinusoidally
and its strength is constant (it does not vary in time but in space). The dots
with bullet points or crosses refer to virtual currents because we are in the
stator and they are shown as conductors that rotate.

In these drawings we can see the distribution of conductors for one of the
three phases (a). B and c would have a similar distribution but with a rotation
of 120 degrees.
What we already can see is that the distribution of conductors is not uniform.
This is something we did not see with the dc motors, where the distribution
was completely uniform.
For instance, we see close to theta 0 that the distribution of conductors is
very sparse (only a few conductors). When we move to 90 degrees, there
are more conductors and more densely together. Thus, the number of
conductors varies sinusouidally.
This is exactly what we see in this formula. Ns or the number of conductors
in the stator is a function of the angle theta, with a certain amplitude and that
it varies sinusoidally on 0 to pi. In pi to 2pi we get a very similar distribution
with the particularity that the currents go away (on the top half the current
comes towards us). All these conductors are connected at both ends in
series so that one current is unique and a magnetic field is created, where its
distribution is sinusoidal.
Now, how do we calculate the magnetic field that is created as a result of the
current (Ampere’s law)? To do the math, we will assume that the current also
varies sinusoidally. This means (b) that at 0 the current is very small and at
90 degrees is maximum. This could seem contradictory, as all the
conductors are connected in series, but the number of conductors varies
sinusoidally making that at different angles we will have a sinusoidal
distribution of the current. Let’s do the math!
Note: In this chapter you do not need to memorize formulas but if you are
required to calculated something, the equation will be given. You are
required to understand and interpret.

So, what we have here is the application of Amperes law.
We need to integrate the magnetic field intensity along a certain closed path,
defined in the figure with the dashed line.
We can again simplify and say that in the rotor and the stator we have
materials with very veryhigh permeability (infinite) so the magnetic field
intensity is 0 (such as in the DC case). Thus, the only part that is left is the
gap which has a non-zero magnetic field intensity.
We have the number 2 because we go twice through the gap.
On the right, we see the integration of the enclosed current through the gap,
so we need to sum up all the enclosed current within that loop. This
becomes a bit more complicated because it varies through the position so
we need to integrate from 0 to pi. We have the number of conductors at this
particular angle times the current going through these conductors.
Now, the right part does not change. The Ns is a constant and it is an
amplitude, additionally the current is a constant so that they can go out of the
integral and we only have the integral of a sin over 0 to pi. This is a cos
theta. So, the Ha in theta depends on the position. It varies sinusoidally
(cosine).
As the distribution of conductors is sinusoidally this is not a surprise. More
conductors, we have a higher magnetic intensity.
If we have the intensity, we can calculate the magnetic flux density by
multiplying by mu and the MMF (magnetomotive force) is the H multiplied by
the length (in Ampere).
7
Field distribution over the air gap
8
Now, how does the magnetic field evolve over time?
Y axis is the MMF, the magnetic intensity or the flux density, it does not make
a difference as they are all proportional to each other (with a scalar). They
vary sinusoidally as we see here. At certain positions the magnetic field is
very high and at others is very small. What we also see with the circles
inside is the distribution of the conductors carrying the current, where at
some points we have very few conductors and at others we have a lot. This
distribution is also sinusoidal.
It is important to see that in the position where the current is 0 (no
conductors) the magnetic field is maximum and viceversa, when it is
maximum (pi/2) the magnetic field is 0. This might be a bit counter intuitive, it
can be explained first mathematically with the fact that the integral of the sine
is a cosine.
8
Why is the magnetic field maximum when the current is
minimum?
9
Physically, the explanation comes from Amperes law. We need to integrate
the current across a closed path as we can see in figure a in order to obtain
the magnetic field intensity (only non-zero).
The currents get added up around the upper closed loop and it becomes
maximum (same sign). Now if we were to build the close loop such as in b,
we can see that the currents compensate each-other and it becomes zero
(compensating the positive with the negative current). Thus, the sum is zero.

Here you can see it in a nice animation of the magnetic fields.
In the upper left, as a function of time, we see the current through all the
conductors (it varies sinusoidally over time).
What we will get is what we see in the second figure (the space vector). We
see the stator, where the currents are maximum at the top and at the bottom,
then the current goes to zero, it increases again and goes to maximum but
negative. At 0 and 180 degrees the current is always zero. So, if the current
varies in time, so will the magnetic field. However, the magnetic field will
always be maximum at 0 and 180 degrees.
The space vector is then either pointing to the left or to the right (depending
on the polarity of the current). Remember that the H varies sinusoidally in
space, but as we see here, it also varies sinusoidally in time. So, in a certain
position, it also goes up and done in time. This is represented by the space
vector which points in the direction of which the magnetic field is maximum.
As we can see, it is always along the horizontal axis because we are only
looking at phase a. At the bottom, we see the developed view. We see on
the x-axis the space and we can see how the magnetic field goes up and
down sinusoidally.
10
Phase a for a 4-pole machine
11
Now what would happen with a 4-pole machine?
It is possible to generate 2 north and 2 south poles. Here we have again a
sinusoidal distribution of conductors but instead of one period, we have two
periods. As a result, the magnetic field also has two periods. How would that
look in animations?
11

riaz/animations/im1phase.html
12
Here we see the solution, in which we have the two periods of the sinusoidal
and the magnetic field varies in time and space as a sinusoidal. This is not
that important for the exam but you should be able to know what happens if
we have 4 poles instead of 2 or even 6 poles.
12
3-Phase winding
13
This is a very important concept. On this slide we show the three phases.
Until now, the story was told from the point of view of phase a, which shows
a distribution of conductors along the whole surface of the stator. How do we
add phases b and c? They will also be distributed along the surface of the
stator with the particularity that they are shifted 120 degrees from each other.
Thus, for phase a, typically the highest magnetic field along the 0 degrees
axis (largest density of conductors is at 90 degrees ).
For phase b, the magnetic field will be maximum around 120 degrees
(highest density of conductors at 210 degrees)
For phase c, the magnetic field is maximum at 240 degrees (highest density
of conductors at 330 degrees).
Thus figure b, represents the three phases. Each of them represents all the
conductors of phase a, b and c where per phase we have a current. These
three phases carry different currents but these vary sinusoidally with the
same frequency, the same amplitude but a phase shift of 120 degrees. They
are again connected in a Y-shape such that the sum of the currents equals to
0.
13
Flux density waveforms
14
How is the magnetic field distributed then?
Here we can see a typical distribution of the magnetic field densities for each
of the phases (a, b, c and total). Remember:
For phase a: 0 crossings at 90 degrees and 180 degrees
For phase b: 0 crossing at 30 degrees and 210 degrees
For phase c: 0 crossing at 150 degrees and 330 degrees
As this is a linear system, all the contributions have to be added up. We can
do superposition of the three magnetic fields and we come up with the
magnetic intensity presented in the lowest figure.
14

15
Here we can see the animations.
Top left is what we have been discussing the whole lecture. For phase a we
have the magnetic field in the x direction. Very similar, we can see the
magnetic field caused by phase B. It varies sinusoidally with the same
amplitude, same frequency but with a phase shift. The reason for this, again,
is because the conductors are distributed in a different manner (phase shift
of 120 degrees). Again, we have phase c which is very similar to a and b with
a phase shift of 120 degrees from phase B.
Thus, we have the three phases.
Now, we need to add up all the contributions (by applying the principle of
superposition). Something very special happens. What can be proved
mathematically is that the sum of the three vectors is a space vector of
constant length, this is what we see over here. What varies now is the
orientation. For the three phases, the direction stays constant but the
resulting space vector rotates at a certain speed. What if we wanted to rotate
at a higher speed? If you wanted it to rotate at a higher speed, you would
need to increase the frequency of the three currents (the omega). In the
middle, we see how the three currents relate to each other.
Now, if the length of the space vector stays the same it means that the
maximum value of the magnetic field remains a constant. The only thing that
varies is the position, which rotates at a certain speed. At another position,
the magnetic field will be zero. For the next chapters, we will talk about two
types of motors: we will have synchronous motors which have a rotor with a
permanent magnet which will follow this space vector (at the same speed).
The other type of motor (induction, asynchronous), the rotor will rotate at a
slightly slower speed. As we showed already, the circles show virtual
currents, like conductors that are moving in the stator (which is not the case
of course). It just means that the current follow a sinusoidal.

16
Ok, now lets go to the formulas. Here, we have the contributions of the three
phases and in black we see the resulting space vector of the magnetic field.
First, the F is the MMF. We can show the one for phase a. It varies with
position and time, where the time component comes from the current. It also
varies with position because it has the sinusoidal distribution of conductors.
Now we are going to say that the MMF can also be represented as a space
vector (from there the arrow hat). It has a varying length (the current), but it
has a 0 position (represented by the angle 0). It is because it moves along
the x axis (red vector). We can do the same for phase b, again a varying
amplitude and the space vector is shifted with 120 degrees in space (green)
and for phase c, the space vector is shifted to 240 degrees (blue). The sum
of these outputs a space vector with a constant length (the black one) but a
varying phase (angle theta fs). If the currents vary at a constant frequency
then we get a constant speed.
16
17
In this animation, we can see in red the magnetic field for the current at
phase a, in green for phase b and in blue for c. Now if we add them up we
see the black line which has a constant amplitude but that it seems to travel
from left to right. This means the angle is always different.
17
Space vector representation of sinusoidal field distribution
18
Now we had the animations, we can show the solutions with the images in
the book. In the figure a, we have a certain situation at time t with the three
space vectors, which can be added up. Then these can tell us at which
position you have the maximum and it tells you where you have the zeros
and maximum.
18
Space-vector representation of combined terminal currents and
voltages
19
From this, we can derive a space vector from the current (is) (a virtual
current). It does not point at the direction where the current is maximum but
rather at the direction where the magnetic field is maximum (actual maximum
is 90 degrees shifted). It is a space vector for the virtual current that created
the magnetic field.

20
So, we have the three phases, the currents that vary sinusoidally with the
same frequency, same amplitude but a phase shift of 120 degrees. We end
up with these equations. Now, these are real currents in time.
From them, we can obtain the resulting space vectors. They have a certain
amplitude, a certain variation in time, and a certain direction (expressed by
the angle). For instance, for phase b we have the component that represents
the direction (<120) and we have the phase shift that represents the shift in
time (cos (wt -120)). Thus, we can prove that the ims, the superposition of
the current has 3/2 times the amplitude of the current that goes through the
real conductors (amplitude is constant) and the angle rotates at a certain
speed omega.

What is a Sinusoidal-waveform Permanent Magnet AC (PMAC)
Motor Drive?
• Permanent Magnet in the rotor
• AC Drive = Rotating magnetic field
• In a nutshell:
Stator windings cause rotating magnetic field
•
Permanent magnet in rotor moves with it.
•
22
We just saw what happens on the stator. We have the three phases (a,b,c)
through which we send sinusoidal currents. With these currents in the stator,
we produce a rotating magnetic field which will create a movement in the
rotor.
Now, how does this movement occur? In different manners, one of them is
the PMAC. Looking at the title, it says sinusoidal permanent magnet, what
can we derive from this?
First, that we are going to have a permanent magnet in the rotor.
Moreover, the AC Drive means that we have a rotating magnetic field.
How does this motor work? In a nutshell, we can say that this type of motor
works in the following manner. We have stator windings that create a rotating
magnetic field, in the rotor the permanent magnet rotates synchronous with
the magnetic field.
22
Which other motor is the PMAC similar to?
PMAC Brushless DC
• 3 phases • 3 phases
• Permanent Magnet • Permanent Magnet
• Produce the torque with • Produce the torque with currents in
currents in the stator the stator
• Sinusoidal currents – on all • DC currents – switched on/off
the time depending on position
• Usage: • Usage:
• Applications with lower • Applications with very high speed
speeds (heavy loads) • Very accurate
• Higher power • Hardest drive PC or drones
23
Now with these components, which other motor that we have studies can we
compare it to?
In a very simplistic view, a PMAC could be considered a brushless DC with
sinusoids. This type of motor is very similar to brushless DC in some
aspects.
Both have a permanent magnet.
Also, the torque is produced by the currents in the stator.
Differences, of course, are in the generation of current, sinusoidal for the
PMAC and DC for the brushless DC, where in the brushless DC the
controller tells us to switch the currents of the phases on/off depending on
the permanent magnet.
When do we use one type or the other of motors?
Brushless DC are typically used for applications with really highspeed where
the speed needs to be controlled very accurately.
Going to AC motors is common for applications requiring lower speeds. This
means heavy loads, where there is a higher need for power.

Principle of Operation: Rotor-Produced Flux
𝐵 (𝑡) = 𝐵(cid:3552) ∠𝜃 (𝑡)
(cid:3045) (cid:3045) (cid:3040)
24
Here we can see the principle of operation.
In a we have again the cross section of our motor. First, we have the stator
that we discussed in the previous chapter (three-phase system). What is new
here? What is new is the rotor, where we have a permanent magnet with one
north pole and one south pole in this example.
Now, we need to be careful to make sure we understand what we are looking
at. Theta m is the angular position of the rotor (it tells us the position of the
north pole relative to the axis a. This angle will vary in time as we assume
that the rotor rotates. Thus, the vector shown in b points at the direction of
the north pole of our rotor. Also here, we will use the concept of space
vector. Of course, make sure that you understand that you are looking at the
space vector of something else, where now the space vector is of the rotor,
B r t. It will vary in time from there its dependence, and the r is from the rotor.
Now, does the amplitude of this space vector change? No, why not?
Because we have a permanent magnet for which we cannot change the flux.
Therefore, the vector has again a constant length but as the rotor rotates, it
has a variable angle. This is what we see in the formula on the top of the
slide. The flux density of the rotor is a vector, that has a constant amplitude
but the angle (expressed by theta) will vary in time.
Finally, what is the speed of the motor? The speed of the motor is the time
derivative of the angle theta

25
Let’s make it a bit more complicated.
In the figure we have phases a, b and c in the stator. Together they create a
rotating magnetic field. That rotating magnetic field is represented by a
space vector, which in this example we use the space vector of the virtual
current. As we said previously, this is a virtual current which represents the
contribution of the three currentsand it also relates to the MMF (the F). From
it, we can derive the H (magnetic field intensity) and from it we can derive the
B (magnetic flux density). Thus, the space vector tells us where the magnetic
field is strongest. In this case, we can see it points to the left upper side,
meaning that at that position, the magnetic field in the stator is the strongest.
90 degrees further it is 0, and 180 degrees further is strongest but in the
opposite direction. Thus, that space vector tells us everything about the
magnetic field created by the stator.
Secondly, we have the magnetic field space vector created at the rotor (Br),
which aligns with the permanent magnet in the rotor.
Now, what is the core message of this slide? That the angle between the two
vectors needs to be 90 degrees. This can be seen from the equation on the
top. The space vector of the current at the stator is equal to an amplitude
and an angle, where the angle related to the theta m (of the movement of the
motor) with 90 degrees shift (90 degrees ahead).

26
Why 90 degrees? This is also seen in figure b. We have the space vector of
the current is, (the current in the stator), which corresponds to a virtual
current distribution in the stator with a maximum going in the south pole and
a minimum on the top. This is virtual, because we have the three phases
with different distributions. Now, why should that angle be 90 degrees?
The simplest explanation, is that it gives us the direction of production of
maximum torque. But why is this the case?
The uncomplete answer is that in that case, the space vector of the rotor
points to the “point” where the virtual current is maximum (maximum B
maximum i). Keep in mind that the space vector tells us the direction in
which the magnetic field is the strongest (highest flux density at the gap
produced by the rotor). Force is Bli, so, if B and the current are maximum
then it gives maximum f.
This is however incomplete. This is just a space vector, so it gives a view of
the distribution. But,it is not the direction of the magnetic field lines. The
magnetic field is all over the gap, with highest density at the direction of the
space vector, zero 90 degrees further, etc. Thus, there is flux everywhere
and that flux is radial. Thereforewe have all types of directions. So, when we
want to calculate the torque, we not only need to look at the highest point,
but we will need to look at every conductor in the stator. Every conductor will
experience a magnetic field with the permanent magnet,thus it will create a
force.
Now, let’s do a small exercise. Try to determine the direction of the force in
the upper conductor?
It would be pointing to the lower right (as in the figure). This is a tangential
force and perpendicular to the magnetic field. This is the direction of the
force of the conductors in the stator. Now, what is the direction of the force in
the rotor? It is opposite, (applying the third postulate of Newton). As this
26
current is very high the force will also be very high. On the other side,
we will also get a similar force but in the other direction. Moreover, we
will get similar forces, but smaller (related to the currents) in all the
conductors in the stator with a slightly different angle (as we assume a
sinusoidal distribution of the flux due to the permanent magnet). All
these forces are tangentialand they all add up, because they produce a
torque in the same direction.
That is actually thereason why you need an angle of 90 degrees. If we
do not have an angle of 90 degrees, some of the conductors will have a
force in the opposite direction, which could lead to a reduction of the
torque. This is avoided by making them an angle of 90 degrees apart.
One more thing, the torque produced will be independent of the angle in
order tomake the torque smooth. This can be mathematically proven as
it will be shown next.
26
Any questions?
