Here we can see the principle of operation.
In a we have again the cross section of our motor. First, we have the stator that we
discussed in the previous session (three-phase system). What is new here? The rotor,
where we have a permanent magnet with one north pole and one south pole in this
example.
Now, we need to be careful to make sure we understand what we are looking at. Theta
m is the angular position of the rotor (it tells us the position of the north pole relative to
the axis a. This angle will vary in time as we assume that the rotor rotates. Thus, the
vector shown in b points at the direction of the north pole of our rotor. Also here, we will
use the concept of space vector. Of course, make sure that you understand that you are
looking at the space vector of something else, where now the space vector is of the
rotor, B r t. It will vary in time from there its dependence, and the r is from the rotor.
Now, does the amplitude of this space vector change? No, why not? Because we have a
permanent magnet for which we cannot change the flux. Therefore, the vector has again
a constant length but as the rotor rotates, it has a variable angle. This is what we see in
the formula on the top of the slide. The flux density of the rotor is a vector, that has a
constant amplitude but the angle (expressed by theta) will vary in time.
Finally, what is the speed of the motor? The speed of the motor is the time derivative of
the angle theta

Let’s make it a bit more complicated. In the figure we have phases a, b and c in the
stator.
Together they create the rotating magnetic field. That rotating magnetic field is
represented by a space vector, which in this example we use the space vector of the
virtual current. As we said in the previous lecture, this is a virtual current which
represents the contribution of the three currents. This space vector current also relates
to the MMF (the F).
From it, we can derive the H (magnetic field intensity) and the B (magnetic flux density).
Thus, the space vector tells us where the magnetic field is strongest. In this case, we
can see it points to the left upper side, meaning that at that position, the magnetic field
in the stator is the strongest.
90 degrees further it is 0, and 180 degrees further is strongest but in the opposite
direction. Thus, that space vector tells us everything about the magnetic field created by
the stator.
Secondly, we have the magnetic field space vector created at the rotor (Br), which aligns
with the permanent magnet in the rotor.
Now, what is the core message of this slide? That the angle between the two vectors
needs to be 90 degrees. This can be seen from the equation on the top.
The space vector of the current at the stator is equal to an amplitude and an angle,
where the angle related to the theta m (of the movement of the motor) with 90 degrees
shift (90 degrees ahead).

Why 90 degrees? This is also seen in figure b. We have the space vector of the current
is, (the current in the stator), which corresponds to a virtual current distribution in the
stator with a maximum going in the south pole and a minimum on the top. Now, why
should that angle be 90 degrees?
The simplest explanation is that it gives us the direction of production of maximum
torque. But why?
The uncomplete answer is that that in that case, the space vector of the rotor points to
the “point” where the virtual current is maximum (maximum B maximum i). Keep in mind
that the space vector tells us the direction in which the magnetic field is the strongest
(highest flux density at the gap produced by the rotor). Force is Bli, so, if B and the
current are maximum then it gives maximum f.
This is however incomplete. This is just a space vector, so it gives a view of the
distribution. But, it is not the direction of the magnetic field lines. The magnetic field is all
over the gap, with highest density at the direction of the space vector, zero 90 degrees
further, etc. Thus, there is flux everywhere and that flux is radial. Therefore we have all
types of directions. So, when we want to calculate the torque, we not only need to look
at the highest point, but we will need to look at every conductor in the stator. Every
conductor will experience a magnetic field with the permanent magnet, thus it will create
a force.
Now, let’s do a small exercise. Try to determine the direction of the force in the upper
conductor?
7
It would be pointing to the lower right (as in the figure). This is a tangential force and
perpendicular to the magnetic field. This is the direction of the force of the conductors
in the stator. Now, what is the direction of the force in the rotor? It is opposite,
(applying the third postulate of Newton). As this current is very high the force will also
be very high. On the other side, we will also get a similar force but in the other
direction. Moreover, we will get similar forces, but smaller (related to the currents) in
all the conductors in the stator with a slightly different angle (as we assume a
sinusoidal distribution of the flux due to the permanent magnet). All these forces are
tangential and they all add up, because they produce a torque in the same direction.
That is actually the reason why you need an angle of 90 degrees. If we do not have
an angle of 90 degrees, some of the conductors will have a force in the opposite
direction, which could lead to a reduction of the torque. This is avoided by making
them an angle of 90 degrees apart.
One more thing, the torque produced will be independent of the angle in order to
make the torque smooth. This can be mathematically proven as it will be shown next.

Let’s calculate the torque.
In the exam you will not be asked to reproduce this reasoning, but you might need to
given the equations, change some parameters and calculate new values. Thus, it is
important to understand where things come from.
Again, we have the situation with the space vector representing the current in the stator
and the space vector representing the magnetic flux density in the rotor. As it can be
seen, they are nicely de-phased by 90 degrees. In addition, we have the distribution of
the current. We will calculate the torque in every conductor. The basic formula for the
force is B times l times I (Lorentz). However, this is more complicated than for the DC
situations. B and I will change depending on the angle (the position). Thus, we can
derive the next formula, where we can calculate the differential of torque (for an
infinitesimal single conductor d si). Torque is r.fem. Thus, we have the r (radius), then we
have the B of the permanent magnet. We will assume a sinusoidal distribution and a
constant amplitude. Then we have the length of the conductor and the current. For the
current we assume that the amplitude always has the same value, where the variability
depends on the number of conductors. Therefore, the factor determines the number of
conductors at the given time. This is provided as a manner of a cosine as we explained
in the previous lecture. It is also sinusoidal.
Now, we need to add up all those forces. It is the integral between -pi/2 and pi/2
multiplied by 2 (because of symmetry). Then, the only thing that needs to be integrated
is the cosine square because everything else is a constant. Thus, we end up with this
formula. This is actually something that we have seen before. The result is that torque is
8
proportional to the amplitude of the current of the stator (Is).This is good news,
because this is what we saw also for DC machines. Now, of course, as we are talking
about sinusoidal currents we have the current amplitude instead of the current. The
constant is again the machine constant where it depends on the motor. You cannot
change this number. If you want to change the torque you will need to place with the
amplitude of the current.

So, What can we do if we want to use the motor as a generator?
We can change the polarity of the current.
When we use sinusoids, the way to reverse the polarity is to dephase the current 180
degrees (phase shift).
This can be seen in the space vectors shown in red. We can control the sinusoids
through the three phases, we control the amplitude (the torque) but we also need to
control the angle of our space vector. Thus, if the space vector is 90 degrees ahead it is
a motor, if the space vector is 90 degrees behind (lagging), then it is a generator. Again,
we need to make sure to have these 90 degrees between the rotor’s flux density and the
virtual space current. How do we make sure of these 90 degrees? We need the sensor
(explained in the first slides) to measure the position of the rotor to keep the 90 degrees.
One clear example of this type of motor is the wind turbines that you see all over the
country. They are PMAC because they become generators.
9
Per-phase equivalent circuit
10
In this session we are not talking much about the voltage and the back-emf except here.
If we look at this model, we have the resistor component, the inductor component (which
is a bit more complicated than in the DC cases) and the back-emf. The back-emf is the
same as before: if the rotor rotates, the windings in the stator will see a change in the
magnetic field and voltage will be induced in the stator windings (Faraday). Thus, we get
a back-emf as in the DC motors. The main difference here is that the back-emf is
sinusoidal and the higher the speed of the rotor the higher the voltage of the back-emf. If
the motor goes quicker the back-emf will have a higher amplitude.
10
Sinusoidal-waveform Permanent Magnet AC (PMAC)
11
Now, let’s look at this overview block diagram.
We start with the utility (220V that come out of the socket). We have a power processing
unit (PPU) which converts the AC into DC (rectifier + capacitors). Then, this voltage is
used to create three currents (a, b, c) which correspond to the three phases. These
currents are of course sinusoidal (same frequency, same amplitude with a phase-shift of
120 degrees). These three currents will drive the motor. This means that they will create
the rotating magnetic field within the stator. This motor will move a mechanical load.
Finally, we will need to have a position sensor.
This is again something that we also needed for brushless DC, where the position of the
rotor was determining the phases of the stator that needed to be powered up.
In here we will also need to measure the position of the rotor to determine the absolute
phase of the three currents.
11
Controller and PPU design and implementation
12
In this slide we see a bit of the implementation. How do we build the controller and how
does it control the electronic circuit? We typically start designing from a desired torque
(we can also start designing from the speed).
From the torque if we have the machine constant, we know our desired current.
Of course, we know this in amplitude while the phase of the current depends on the
position of the rotor. 90 degree ahead or lagging. Depending on both the desired current
amplitude and phase you can derive the three desired phase currents, which are
sinusoidal with the same amplitude and a 120 degrees phase shift between them but the
absolute phase depends on the theta angle. Now for the controller, we will typically have
a control loop, where we can measure the obtained current (here presented for the a
phase). Then we have the pwm signal which controls the opening and closing of the
switch.
12
Sinusoidal current obtained
13
This process is a bit more complicated than in the DC cases because the current
depends on the amplitude and the frequency. Thus, typically we will have a reference
current and the actual current will fluctuate due to the PWM. In this figure, it is actually
exaggerated as we see only 10 cycles in the sinusoidal. In practice we will have
something like 1000 cycles of the PWM sinusoidal with lower amplitude. This means
that the sinusoidals are not that extreme.

Three-phase, squirrel cage, induction motors
15
Here you can see how the induction motor is constructed.
At the left-hand side (a) we see something that should look familiar to you.
In the stator, we have these three phases (a, b, c) used to generate the rotating
magnetic field.
Now, in the previous type of motor, we had a permanent magnet in the rotor. This
permanent magnet rotates at the same speed as the rotating magnetic field. That is why
we call them synchronous motors.
What is the big difference for induction motors?
We will not have a permanent magnet, but we will have a cage (b), which is called a
squirrel cage. In the rotor there are bars of iron and at the end they have these shortcut
rings that are connecting the different bars. This is the only thing we have in the rotor.
This is, as we can imagine, much cheaper than the permanent magnet.
What is the working principle here?
• We have the rotating magnetic field (stator).
• If we look at one single bar of the rotor, it will experience a change of magnetic field
(rotating magnetic field).
• A change in the magnetic field provokes a voltage (Faraday).
• The voltage is generated across those bars, and as the bars are resistive, then we
will have current running through them (induced).
• Thus, we have the stator magnetic field, and we have the induced currents. They
interact and due to Lorentz forces, we have torque.
There are a few more details that we will see next.
15
Principles of operation
16
At the left hand side (a), we have the three sinusoidal voltages of the phases (a, b, c).
Each one drives a coil. These coils are connected in a Y-shape so the sum of the
currents are zero. What is new, is the figure in the right but you should have seen it in
other courses. First of all, be careful, these are not space vectors, they are fasors (flat
hat, no arrow).
What is indicated is that the voltage leads the current with 90 degrees. Why is this
important? What is true for fasors is also true for space vectors, if in the space vectors
the voltage was leading by 90 degrees, the same happens in the fasors.
16
Space vector and fasor representation
17
Here we see the relation between the fasors and space vectors.
First, in figure a, we have the space vector for the magnetic field and the space vector
for the current that causes the magnetic field (superposing each other).
They rotate at a speed omega, which is called the synchronous speed. We can also
associate a space vector to the voltage, which is actually attached to the induced
currents, also related to the rotating omega sync.
In b and c we see the representations of the voltage vs the current with the 90 degrees
angle as fasors and the circuital representation of the motor with the inductance.
17
Two-winding transformer
18
Now this is a very important slide. In it, we will understand the similarities with
transformers.
When we talked about transformers in the second lecture, we said that we would need
them later for induction machines.
Here, we can remember how transformers work.
The first difference here, is that the figure in a is not really a transformer. Why is that?
Because we have the air gap to make the link with the motor. In a motor, we have a
stator and a rotor that move independently. In the representation here we can say that
the primary side corresponds to the stator and the secondary side corresponds to the
rotor.
What do we need to remember?
• In a transformer, if we apply a voltage on the primary side and it will induce a
magnetic flux (from Faraday’s law)
• If there is a flux, there is a current im. So, this is the current that we need to create a
flux through the core. Now, as this is an alternating voltage, the flux is an alternating
flux.
• If the flux changes, a voltage appears in the secondary side.
• As we have a load and it is resistive, a current i2 is generated.
• If the current appears by Ampere’s law a flux is created (fi 2).
• In order to compensate this flux, we will need a current i2 prime at the primary side
(conservation of energy).
• It does not mean that those currents are equal, we have the turn ratio on both sides
(N1 and N2). What is the same is the flux generated by both: the flux generated by i2
18
is equal in magnitude but opposite to the one generated by i2’. Thus, we have two
components in the primary side. One component im to get the flux through the
material and one component i2’ to compensate for i2.
In an induction machine, we will have the same working principle. A current
generates the rotating magnetic field (the flux m). But, since we have currents in the
rotor bars, we need a second component i2 prime to compensate them.
In the right-hand side, we see the model. It is an ideal transformer where we assume
that there is no magnetizing current. The magnetizing current is shown in parallel with
im. Because of the magnetizing current, a current is generated in the secondary side
and as a counter effect, a current i2’appears in the primary side.

19
Let’s start with the things that we are familiar with.
First we see in (a) the space vector.
As you remember, the space vector of the rotating magnetic field points at the direction
of the highest magnetic field. Moreover, we have the rotating angular velocity omega
sync and at 90 degrees phase shift, we have the voltage (vs) also rotating at omega
sync.
The cross sections here show the bars in the rotor.
The rotor rotates at a speed omega m. In general, this omega m will be lower that
omega sync.
Why is this important? Because if the speed is the same, we would not induce currents.
Let’s start with the motor omega m = 0.
• If a bar stands still, it will observe that the magnetic field fluctuates (or rotates) ( It is
first very high and that then it drops).
• The flux density changes, then a voltage is generated. This is what we see in the
second equation.
• This voltage will not be the same in every bar. It depends on the position (magnetic
field rotating). As we can see the back-emf depends on u (the relative speed).
• This does not only work when the rotor is stopped but also when the rotor rotates as
long as the speed is different from the synchronous speed, because the u is actually
the relative speed. In this case, the u is the r.omega slip. Omega slip is the difference
between the sync speed minus the rotor speed.
• Finally the B varies sinusoidally in the air gap.
19
Thus, conclusion, we induce a voltage in every bar (they see a change in magnetic
field). Why do we have a positive voltage down a negative voltage up and zero?
Positive is because the flux is going out, negative is because it is going in, zero is
because the flux is zero.
19
How are the currents induced in the rotor bar?

𝑖 θ =
(cid:3029)(cid:3028)(cid:3045)
(cid:3019)
(cid:3277)(cid:3276)(cid:3293)
20
Here we see the representation of what we said before.
If there is a voltage in a bar and this bar is resistive, then there will be a current passing
through it.
Thus, the current is equal to the voltage (from the previous slide) divided by the resistor
(Ohm’s law).
In every bar and every position we get a current. What we see in b is the developed
view of the cage. The two rings are at both sides and each bar is represented by the
voltage induced and the resistor. As we saw in the previous slide, these voltages will be
different for every bar (following the sinusoidal distribution of the magnetic field).
Therefore, in every bar we will have a different current. The sum of the currents will be
zero. Why is that? The simplest answer is Kirchhoff law. As the ring as a node (where all
the bars are inter-connected), the sum of currents in a node is zero.
This is actually also ensured by the law of symmetry, voltages on the top bars have the
same voltage at the ones at the bottom but opposite in polarity.
One more thing, we will have the maximum current in the down bar, and that coincide
with the maximum of the magnetic field (the direction of the space vector).

21
Let’s try to show the concepts of this slide it step by step:
• In a we can see the three phases in the stator.
• In addition, we have the space vector of the magnetic field with the omega sync (the
speed of the rotating magnetic field).
• We have the space vector of the voltage (90 degrees shift) and the currents a, b and
c that create the magnetic field. This is of course everything in the stator.
• Now, we will also have currents in the rotor (induced by the voltage). This is just like a
transformer: the voltage and current from the primary side cause a current on the
secondary side. Some bars have smaller currents, some have bigger ones and the
value of the currents depends on the voltage.
Now we can go back to the transformer analogy.
• There are currents in the rotor, and they will produce a magnetic field (Ampere).
Where is this magnetic field the strongest? Parallel to the a-axis. Why is that? If you
remember from the previous lecture, when we create a close loop as in the figure, the
magnetic field will be maximum (all the currents are added and they have the same
polarity). If we choose a perpendicular path, the enclosed current will be zero (two
polarities). So, at the positions parallel to the a-axis we will have the maximum
magnetic field caused by the rotor (secondary side).
• What would be the direction of the magnetic field? Right hand rule (aligned with the
crosses). The magnetic field is clockwise.
• Just like in a transformer, there needs to be a compensating current (in the primary
side) to compensate this flux, because of conservation of energy (the overall flux is
21
dependent on the applied voltage and this one cannot change). What actually can
change is the current.
• In the stator windings we will see a second component that appears.
• We have ima, imb and imc, where to each of them a second component is added
(ira’, irb’ and irc’). This is a second component that compensates for the rotor flux.
• They will produce a magnetic field that will perfectly compensate the rotor flux. This
means that flux m, ir’ (in the stator) is equal but opposite from flux m, ir.
To sum up, in the currents that will be drawn from the power supplies consist of two
components, one that generate the magnetic rotating field and a second component
that compensates for the rotor’s currents.
The nice thing is that you can induce these currents, we do not need as in DC motors
to have these brushes.
In the right hand side, the b figure, explains actually the same story but with space
vectors. We have the space vectors of the rotating magnetic field (Bms) and the
current that creates the magnetic field (ims) and the voltage we can associate with it.
The F is not a force, but an MMF (in Amperes). It corresponds to the different fluxes.
• Fr corresponds to flux r.
• This mmf needs to be compensated by a flux that is equal in magnitude and
opposite in direction (Fr ‘).
• Of course, this MMf is created by currents in the stator (ir’).
• Thus, in the stator we will have ims and ir’ which are actually perpendicular to each
other. Why is this the case? The rotating magnetic field has is highest strength in
the y axis negative and the flux induced by rotor current has its maximum along the
x-axis. Then, the total current in the stator has two components and the sum of
them is is. As we can see, it is not aligned anymore with the Bms. Thus, Bms will
not change direction but the space vector will be at some other angle.
Finally, it is important to know that all the space vectors that we have rotate at a
synchronous speed. The only thing that does not rotate synchronously is the rotor
and its bars.
A few equations to wrap up. The stator MMF has two components, one space vector
for the magnetic field and one space vector from the induced magnetic field (from the
rotor currents).
Same is true for the currents.
We can prove that the current in the stator (caused by the current of the rotor) has a
certain amplitude and that is proportional to the slip frequency.
Why is that? What happens if we have a high slip frequency? It means that the rotor
rotate relatively slow and the bars absorb magnetic field.
In the formula, we would have a high relative speed which make a relatively high
voltage, a relatively high current in the rotor so you need a lot of compensation in the
stator? For this reason the amplitude of the current created in the stator due to the
rotor is proportional to the slip frequency.

Here we can make a summary. The most important message is that Fr and Fr’ rotate at
synchronous speed (thus the angle always remain at 90 degrees)

What we see here, we have already explained: Space vector for the magnetic field,
space vector for the voltage. There is always a 90 degree angle and they rotate at sync
speed.
The rotor rotates at omega m.
At time 0 (a), we can look at the direction of the B space vector (point p or one of the
rotor bars). A little bit later we will be at t1 and the space vectors will have moved and
the angle is omega sync times t1. Point p will be a bit less far away because it moves at
wm. And now, the maximum current will be at another rotor bars. Eventually, we will
notice that the voltage in the rotor bars are varying sinusoidally at the slip frequency.
This has to do with the relative speed u from the formula depends on the differences
between the two frequencies. Thus, the omega slip is the speed at which the voltage will
alternate in the rotor. So, if the slip frequency is zero, then there is no different of speed
and it will be a DC current.
A few definitions: the slip s, is the ratio between the omega slip and the omega sync.
The slip frequency is the ratio between the omega slip and the omega sync times the
sync frequency. We are always talking about a few herzs (40Hz to 38Hzs meaning the
slip is 2 Hz).

Torque-speed characteristic
25
In here we can see the motor characteristic. It is just a graphical representation of what
we have been saying. We have torque in the x axis vs speed in the y axis. And in the
second the other way around. If the sync speed is the same as the wm, then the torque
is 0. If the slip frequency increases, then the relative speed increases, the induced
voltage increases (e = blu) and the induced current increases and so does the torque.
25
Operation of an inductor motor
26
Suppose that the load becomes heavier. We are first at wm and TL1 but we need a
higher torque. Then the system wm will slow down, meaning that the slip frequency will
increase, leading to a higher torque.
26
Acceleration torque during start-up until steady state
27
We have been talking all the time about a linear relation between torque and omega m,
but in fact, this only happens in the steady state. The motor characteristic is shown here.
In addition we have a typical loading profile with an almost quadratic behavior.
The message here is that the motor is self starting. At zero speed TL is 0, and Tem is
positive, so the rotor will start rotating. It accelerates until we arrive at a certain point
where the torque decreases until the Tacc is zero (Tem is equal to TL) and it will reach
the steady state that means that there is no acceleration anymore, and the motor
controls itself.
Thus this motor has several advantages:
1. It is easy to build
2. It controls itself (we do not need sensors to control)
But one disadvantage, it is not easy to control the speed, we do not know about the
torque load so it is difficult to control the speed.
Thus, this is an async motor because it does not rotate at the same sync speed.
