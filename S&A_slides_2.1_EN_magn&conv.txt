One concept that will come in handy when we talk about AC and induction motors:
transformers.
A transformer is two inductors magnetically coupled. It is often defined by its function.
In this situation, we have a ring with very high permeability (very low reluctance) so that
it easily lets flux be generated through and we have two sets of windings: a primary side
(e1) and a secondary side (e2).
Now suppose we apply a voltage at the primary side (constant; sinusoidal or squared),
as a result there will be a flux given by faradays law (a voltage causes a change in the
flux).
Together with the flux we will get a current im or magnetizing current (which is
proportional to the flux and in phase).
This flux is also going through the secondary side.
As Faraday goes in both directions, the changing flux will generate a voltage in the
second set of windings (e2).
Now, we can divide the two equations, we get the ratio of the voltage is equal to the ratio
of the number of turns (which is most probably a familiar equation).

Now we can look at the model. We have the ideal transformer converting e1 into e2 but
not taking into account the fact that the magnetizing current goes through an inductor to
create the flux. This is just a model, where the Lm just signifies that we need a magnetic
field to create the flux.

Now we will complicate the system: we will connect a resistive load at the secondary
side.
• First, voltage e1 creates a flux fi m.
• The flux creates a voltage e2 at the secondary side.
• There is a resistor load, at e2, Ohm’s applies and we get current i2.
• And what happens when there is a current? A flux is created by Ampere’s law (it goes
counterclock wise).
• Now following the same reasoning, the changing flux fi 2 goes to the primary side.
So, does it cause the voltage e1 because of Faraday? No, it is not possible because
e1 is an applied voltage and that won’t change.
• The only thing that can change is that an additional current is created on top of the im
of before. It will be i2 prime which runs in the primary side. So, it is a secondary
component of the primary side.
• What will happen? That this secondary component will create a secondary flux that
compensates for the primary one. This means in the figure: i2 causes fi 2. Fi 2 causes
i2 prime, which causes fi2 prime. And fi 2 prime counters fi 2 so that they are in
balance.
• How do we know this? Because of Faradays law. If the voltage e1 cannot change, the
total flux cannot change either so the fi 2 and fi 2 prime cancel each other and the
total flux stays at fi m.
• Finally, as the magnetic circuit is the same, the mmfs have to be the same (because
the flux is the mmf/reluctance). This formula is the opposite of the voltage, and that is
so because of the conservation of energy, if the voltage is high at the primary side
6
and low on the secondary side, the current is the other way around, that’s why the
relation is opposite for the currents.

If we look at the model of the real transformer. It is the one of the ideal transformer but
with the magnetizing inductor. Sometimes, we will just ignore the magnetizing inductor
assuming infinite permeability. This means infinite inductance, thus, it does not require
any effort to get the flux over.
But here, we have the current at primary size, which is the magnetizing current (to
create the flux) plus the reflected current load (which will always be there).
7
Introduction to transformers: Real vs Ideal
8
This will come back later when looking at the model of a real transformer. In summary,
we have the ideal transformer and on top of that, we have the inductance to model the
magnetizing current (in case the inductance is not infinity). We also have the inductor for
the leakage, and the resistor for the winding. Finally, we have hysteresis losses (which
will cause to heat up) and eddy current losses (Rhe),
8
Introduction to transformers: Eddy current losses
9
In the situation, we have the coil that goes around the ring. A changing flux will cause a
voltage in any close path (loop). Such at what we see in the first figure.
A voltage means a current flowing through the path. This means that the magnetic core
has a non-zero resistivity and it makes a loss.
To avoid this, we laminate the material of the magnetic core. You will see this in the lab
as well. So, we slice them, we put a bit of barnish (an insulator) and we glue them
together. In this way, the loop becomes smaller, the flux becomes tinier, making the
current very small, and so do the loss. So the eddy currents are reduced. In summary
we laminate to limit the eddy currents. The eddy currents are not always bad. For
instance, they can be used at the bottom of your pot for cooking with induction.

Electric machines (or motors) convert electrical power input into mechanical output.
These machines may be operated solely as motors, but they can also enter a generating
mode when slowing down (during generative breaking), where the power flow is
reversed. We will explain this later today.
11
Basic structures of motors (1)
Stator
Air Gap
Rotor
12
We often describe electric machines by viewing a cross-section, as if the machine were
cut by a plane perpendicular to the shaft axis and viewed from one side.
Because of symmetry, this cross-section can be taken anywhere along the shaft axis.
In the second figure, we can see that all machines have a stationary part (called the
stator), a rotating part (call the rotor), separated by an air gap, thereby allowing the rotor
to rotate freely on a shaft (supported by bearings).
The stator is firmly affixed to a foundation to prevent it from turning.
12
Basic structures of motors
13
In order to require small ampere-turns to create flux lines crossing the gap (figure a),
both the rotor and the stator are made up of high-permeability ferromagnetic materials,
and the length of the air gap is kept as small as possible.
The stator-produced flux distribution of figure a is shown for a 2-pole machine where the
field distribution corresponds to a combination of a single north pole and a single short
pole (figure a). This is the most common situation.
Often there are more than 2 poles, for example 4 or 6. This is the case of the figure b.
Due to complete symmetry around the periphery of the airgap, it is sufficient to consider
only one pole pair consisting of adjacent north and south poles. Other pole pairs have
identical conditions of magnetic fields and currents.
Finally, if the rotor and the stator are perfectly round, the air gap is uniform, and the
reluctance in the path of flux lines crossing the air gap is uniform. Machines with such
structures are called non-salient pole machines.
Sometimes, the machines are purposely designed to have saliency so that the magnetic
reluctance is unequal along various paths as shown in Figure c. This saliency is called
reluctance torque and it is a significant means of producing torque.

Let’s see how coils produce magnetic fields in electric machines.
A concentrated coil of Ns turns is placed in two stator slots 180 degrees (full-pitch)
apart. There is one current coming in and at the other side it is coming out. This current
will generate a magnetic field.
Let’s consider the magnetizing flux lines that completely cross the two air gaps. What
are the H and B? Let’s apply Ampére.
The path looks a bit difficult to integrate. But, we need two considerations:
1. The permeability of the iron is assumed to be infinite, hence the H-fields on the rotor
and stator are zero
2. The flux lines in the air gaps are radial, that is in the direction that goes through the
center of the machine. Because magnetic field choose the path of lowest reluctance
and in this case it is the shortest path.
Applying Ampere, we have 2Hslg = Nsis, Why the factor 2? Because for each closed
loop we need to go through the gap twice. Thus, the magnetic field intensity is equal to
the number of windings times the current, divided by two times the length of the gap.
Now, the total mmf acting along the path is Ns is. By symmetry, half of the total ampere-
turns (Nsis/2) are consumed or acting in making the flux lines cross each air gap length.
Hence, the mmf Fs on each air gap is Nsis/2.
Associated with Hs, the flux density Bs is multiplied by the permeability of the air.
What can we say of the value of B close to the gap but in the iron? It should be almost
the same. Because there is only one flux in total, the same everywhere. The equation of
B is valid everywhere as we did not take position of the airgap into account.
All quantities directed away from the center are considered positive
14
In the figure b:
• we see the developed view as if the circular cross-section were flat. The field
distribution is a square wave . All three stator produced field quantities are
proportional to the instantaneous value of the stator current is(t). Therefore, in the
figure, all three characteristics can be represented with different scales.
• In the structure we can consider the theta 0 as the axis (the magnetic axis of the
winding). It goes through the center of the machine in the direction of the flux lines
produced by a positive value of the winding current and it is perpendicular to the
plane in which the winding is located.
• We see the variation of B in position theta relative to the axis. The flux is constant
until it changes sign. Why? Because it changes direction. It happens at pi/2. Now
suppose mu is not infinite? How would the figure change? And where would B be
higher? Close to the conductor, the flux will be the highest ( shortest path). Higher
at pi/2 and lower at 0.

Basic principles of operation
1. An electromagnetic force is produced on a current-carrying
conductor when it is subjected to an externally-established
magnetic field
2. An emf is induced in a conductor moving in a magnetic field
15
So, how can we make the motor move? It is a combination of electrical currents and
magnetic fields. Two principles are fundamental:
1. From the first one, the current in the rotor is combined with a magnetic field
externally. We need a current and we need a magnetic field and they will generate a
force.
2. The second shows that an emf is induced in a conductor in a magnetic field
15
1. Electromagnetic force: An electromagnetic force is produced
on a current-carrying conductor when it is subjected to an
externally-established magnetic field
is related to LORENTZ FORCE 𝐹⃗ = 𝑞𝐸 + 𝑞𝑣⃗𝑥𝐵
(cid:3032)(cid:3040)
Left hand rule
16
The electromagnetic force is related to the lorentz forces, which relates electrical and
magnetic fields to a force.
In this course we will only focus on the magnetic field part, where qv represent the
current which is vectorially multiplied by the magnetic field density B.
In order to maximize the product, i and B are perpendicular. As such the fem is B times i
times l and in the ortogonal plane formed by B and I.
You notice that the length of the conductor plays a role. Why is that? Because the longer
the conductor the more space the electrons have to move in it.
To know the direction you can use the left hand side rule fbi as shown in the picture.
16
Electric force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic
field
17
As shown in the first figure, the direction of the force is perpendicular to the direction of
both i and B.
To obtain the direction of the force, we will superimpose the flux lines produced by the
conductor current (figure b).
The flux lines add up to the right side of the conductor and subtracts on the left side
(Figure c).
So, the force fem acts from the higher concentration of flux lines to the lower one.
17
Question: What is the direction of the electromagnetic force in
this case
18
The conductor is carrying a current into the paper plane in the presence of an external
uniform field. Solution: the flux lines are clockwise and add up on the upper-right side,
hence , the direction of the fem is to the lower left side.
18
2. Induced emf: An emf is induced in a conductor moving in a
magnetic field
is related to LORENTZ FORCE and FARADAY’S LAW

19
A conductor of length l is moving to the right at a speed u with charges. The B field is
uniform and isin perpendicular direction into the paper. So we can use the FBI rule
here. In practice conductors move into a cylinder not a plane.
What speed is the highest? The one induced by the current or the conductor moving
(u)? It is the one of the u, which is much higher than the induced one.
So, lets use faradays law. When the conductor moves, we assume a rectangle (shown
in blue).
The conductor moving makes the rectangle larger and larger. We can look at faraday.
The flux is B times the area. B is assumed constant so it is the derivative of the area,
which moves in the x axis, so l is also a constant. The derivative of the x on time is the
speed, so this means B times l times u. This is a simplified form of faradays law. We
have a conductor moving through a magnetic field, irrespective of the current through
that conductor we get a voltage. This is actually where the back emf comes from. In
motors a voltage is generated because we have conductors moving in a magnetic field.
Also important, the polarity of the voltage is independent from the current running in the
conductor.

Question: What is the polarity of the induced emf?
21
Here we have a conductor in a magnetic field moving at a certain speed. What is the
polarity ? In the first one, polarity is towards us, In the other one it is the other way
around.

22
Here we see the cross section of the motor; stator outside rotor inside.
The dashed lines are the magnetic field. This means we have magnetic field through the
air gap, and it is perpendicular to the rotor.
We also have conductors in the rotor.
Moreover, we assume a current source ir at the rotor.
The current is generated in the electrical system and the voltage er is an induced
voltage (the back emf).
We also have a torque counterclockwise because of the forces. As a result the rotor will
rotate at a certain speed omega m.
When the conductor moves around the shaft at a certain point it ends up 180 degrees
further and the current has to reverse ( to have the torque in the same direction and
constant). This is what we see in the graph. The first 180 degrees the current is positive
and the second part it needs to be reversed. We need a mechanism that ensures this.
Second; the induced voltage also changes polarity, why? Because the conductor is
moving; u does not change but the direction of the magnetic field does. The torque is
kept constant.
Lets see with the equations. We can do the torque for one conductor, it is the fem times
the radios of the rotor. Now for the 2 N conductors, N is the number of windings and as
for each one we have two conductors, it is time 2. All the forces of each of the windings
add up and we have 2N. We can do the same for the induced voltage. Now, torque is
the multiplication of a set of parameters of which only the current is variable. So, as we
already said last week, the torque is proportional to the current. Similar, for the voltage,
it is proportional to the angular speed. Note that the constant is the same, and it is called
22
machine constant.

Now, we have the two formulas torque and angular velocity. So, calculate the electrical
power (v times i) and the mechanical power (torque times angular speed). We fill in the
formulas from before. They are equal! Mechanical power equals electrical power in the
ideal case.

25
Now we go back to the original figure. What would happen if we change the direction of
the current not of the rotation. We assume the rotor keeps rotating at omega m because
of the inertia. You can change the direction of the current very easily. What will change?

Safe operation of motors
27
Finally it is important to know that every motor has nominal speed and nominal torque
which will depend on voltage and currents that can be applied. So, in following lectures
we will learn how to deal with them and take the best out them.
