What is flow?
“The action or fact of moving along in a steady, continuous stream”
• Flow or Q is the amount of cubic meters per second that go through a pipe
• We can measure flow of:
Gasses
o
Fluids
o
(Depending on the application)

Thermal anemometers
• Gas flow meter
• HOT WIRE
• Second wire for thermal compensation
• Low Flow possible
• Not linear

The first flow sensor is also the cheapest one.
It is a very simple sensor to measure air flow.
It is used to measure the inflow of air into the motor of a car to know the
amount of air sucked into the motor for the explosion.
The air flows through a string wire which measures the speed of air.
If we know the cross-section of the pipe, we know the amount the volume
per second flowing through the pipe.
This is a hot wire thermal anemometer. How do we measure in the wire? We
have a resistive wire with a certain resistance (1KOhm, for instance). If we
heat up this wire, and some air flows over it, it will cool down. There is a
relation between the speed of air blowing to the wire and the temperature of
it (because we are cooling down the wire).
Moreover, as the wire functions as a sort of thermal sensor (thermal
resistor), we can measure the resistance of the wire and it will be a
measurement of the amount of the speed of air going through that wire.
Of course, the change of resistance is too small to measure with an Ohm
meter so we can use again a Wheatstone bridge.
Then, we can see that the current will change with the temperature and with
the flow. Thus, we can find a relation between the current and the velocity of
the air flow (square of the current and root of the velocity). It is not at all
linearbut we could calibrate it.
The problem with this system is the one we have already seen multiple
times. This system is measuring absolute values. Moreover, we are not
taking into accountthe temperature or the composition of the air (wet or dry).
How could we make a better system? We would need to make it differential.
For it, we could just take two hot wires instead of one. Then we pass a
4
current (big enough) through those wires to heat them up. Now we
could put one wire on the stream of air and the other completely out of it
(same temperature, same air). Thus, we have one with flow and one
without. Then, we have a differential measurement of the effect of the
flow of air on the resistance. The measurement will not be linear
(external factors)but we could calibrate them.

Variable-Pressure-Drop Meter with Sharp-Edge orifice
"Obstruction" Meters – Fluid Flow measurement
5
This is perhaps the most used flow sensor in industry to measure fluids.
We have a pipeand we will put an obstruction (a plate with a small orifice at
the center). Thus, we will have two sections (the pipe and the orifice).
What happens with the flow then? If we have a flow through the pipe, we will
have a certain flow pattern as it goes through the orifice. Behind the
obstruction we will have some turbulence, which will force the flow to go in a
certain shape.
This shape is difference from the orifice section or the tube section.
Moreover, we will have a pressure drop before and after the orifice. This
change of pressure is what will give use the value of the flow. If the flow is
very fast, the pressure will drop more.
We can see this in the plot. We have the static pressure,we enter through
the orifice and the pressure drops. We can measure the change of pressure
between the two points to have a differential pressure sensor (before and
after the orifice).
However, there is a drawback. We will have a certain permanent drops.

There are different options depending on how the structure used, where the
flange taps is the most widely used.

What is the relation between the flow and the pressure drop? Is it linear?
Unfortunatelyit is not. Why? Because it is linked to the turbulences behind
the orifice. They force the flow into a certain shape.
Let’s look at the formula.
We can first see a relation between the theoretical flow Q and the drop of
pressure. The higher the pressure drop the higher the flow qt (theoretical
flow rate).
We will need to take into accountthe mass density and the cross sections of
the flow areas.
However, we do not really know the cross-section flow areas, right? We
know the cross-section of the pipe, of the hole but not of the shape of the
flow. Thus, there are some issues here.
But perhaps there is again a relation between flow section area, pipe section
area and orifice section area.

That is where we can actually definethe discharge coefficient, which tells us
the relation between the cross-section of the flow, the pipe, and the orifice.
Is this a constant coefficient?
No, because the flow pattern depends on the orifice diameter and on the flow
itself.
That is why we need a graph to be able to model the discharge. It relates
the discharge coefficient and the Reynolds number (the ratio of inertial forces
to viscous forces within fluid that is subjected to relative internal movement due to
different fluid velocities-a measurement of the turbulences). Beta is ratio of the
orifice and the pipe diameters. Thus, the bigger the ratio, the closer in size
these are.
In the first case, beta is 0.8. This means that the discharge coefficient is
almost 1. This is normal as there is nearly no change in section area.
However, this is only the case for lower values of the Reynolds number or
low turbulences speeds.
When the orifice is smaller (0.2), the coefficient becomes more important and
so is also the diameter of the orifice.
There is some good news: when the flow is high enough to have enough
turbulences, the discharge coefficient stabilizes around 0.65, independent of
the section of the orifice.
This means that this type of sensor will only be used for big flow velocities.
For small flows it is too variable.
We can then have this nice equation. In it we can use the cross section of
the pipe and the orifice with the discharge coefficient.
8
Of course, this is not a linear relation, we still have a square root of the
pressure drop.
What did the manufacturers do about the discharge coefficients, and
pressure permanent drops?

Variable-Pressure-Drop Meter: Flow Nozzle, Venturi Tube, Dall
Flow Tube
9
They developed their own orifices, which are not sharp-edged anymore.
We will have three major systems, flow nozzle, venturi tube and dallflow
tube.
They have a very important thing in common, they try to simulate the flow
pattern of the fluid.
While the sharp edge had a sort of obstruction with a hole, these follow the
flow of the patterns. This means that the Cd is almost one as the flow pattern
will be very similar to the flow of the orifice at least for the flow nozzle and
the venturi tube, the dallflow has other advantages. As the discharge factor
is close to 1 and nearly constant, these will also work with small flows.

The Differential Pressure Flow Measuring Principle (Orifice-Nozzle-Venturi)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUd4WxjoHKY
10
Here we can see a comparison of these three sensors. What we see is that
flow nozzle and venturi have nearly one discharge factor, while the dall-tube
is more around 0.68. But,it has the smallest permanent pressure drop.
The clogging could be bad with the sharp edge. In here it is better because
of the type of orifice.
Venturi has the best accuracy
The long termaccuracy is also better that for the sharp edge (as they are
less affected by erosion).
Here you can also find a link with a very nice explanation of the flow
measuring principle with differential pressure.

11
This is a special type of differential pressure flow sensor.
If you have a close look, there is a fine mesh inside (a honeycomb structure),
where we create a laminar pattern. The flow does not change patternbut it
goes through the mesh. We will have a pressure drop but in the laminar
manner.
While obstruction meters only work in one direction, this one will work both
way. There are just laminar elements, it has the same shape from both sides.
Moreover, the pressure drop is proportional to the flow. This is another big
advantage
The disadvantage? It will only work for gas. The honeycomb will be much too
meshed to actually letthrough anything else than gas.

𝑥∓𝑣 𝑐𝑜𝑠θ
(cid:3030)
This is NO DOPPLER
12
This sensor is also used for measuring the flow of fluids. First of all, this
sensor is not measuring doppler effects.
We have a pipe where a fluid (water, blood) is flowing. We can measure the
speed of sound through that pipe, it will actually changewith the speed of the
fluid. If we put a transmitter (A) and a receiver (B), we transmit a burst. The
difference on the receiving time will provide the speed of the fluid. We need
to put them in an angle, where the transit time is in relation to speed of
sound, the diameter, the distance and angle.
This is very interesting to measure the blood flow, where we cannot use
obstruction meters. This instrument can be outside of the blood vessel. An
example can be seen here. In it, we have the transmitter on the probe that
can be embracing the vessel. We add a reflectorand we can measure the
time taken between the transmitted signal and the received one.

This is the state of the art on flow meters.
Flow is actually velocitybut do you remember when we talked about how
difficult it was to measure velocity? As we also said, there is only one
equation that really relates velocity and voltage. This was the movement of a
wire through a magnetic field, as we did in Tachometers.
Can we use this for fluids? Yes!
We can have a tube, and we make two holes with electrodes (S1, S2). The
fluid will connect the two electrodes as a wire. Of coursewe will need a
magnetic field and we will fulfill the law.
13
Electromagnetic Flowmeters: Working principles (1)
14
Thus, it will look like this. We can create a voltage difference between the
two electrodes, if we have a magnetic field of a certain length (the diameter
of the tube) and a certain velocity of the fluid.
14
Electromagnetic Flowmeters: Working principles (2)
15
It would look like this.
First, the pipe needs to be plastic. If we had a metal tube, the electrodes
would be short circuited the whole time.
In applications it would look like the figure on the left. We have the tube,the
sensors and the magnetic field is created by means of a permanent magnet
or a coil.
15
Electromagnetic Flowmeters: Industrial application
16
For industrial applications it can be used like in the image. We have the coils,
top and bottom. The electrodes will be catching the voltage due to the fluid
speed.

Electromagnetic Flowmeters: Healthcare application
17
This is very good for biomedical instrumentation because again it does not
cause any obstruction.

o
Generated voltage for 6cm tube at flow of 400 l/min is approx. 3mV
o
18
There are of course one drawback to these systems.
The fluid needs to be a conductoror we will not be able to have any voltage.
The resistance of the fluid is needed.
For instance, let’s use the case of tap water which has a conductivity of 200
microSiemensper cm, for an electrode diameter of 0.64cm, we have a
resistance of 7800 Ohms. Is thisok? Yes, it is ok. This resistance will be the
one of the divisor, and if we want to measure it, we will need an amplifier with
a bigger impedance than this 7800 Ohms, these are usually ok!
We will therefore need a minimum conductivity of 5 microSiemens/cm
Thus, no alcohol or gasoline are permitted.
What type of voltages are we talking about? For 6cm tube at flow of
400littlers/min, the generated voltage is 3mV, which is good to amplify.

Why is this a recent evolution when it just requires electromagnetic fields?
These sensors have been due to an evolution.
First, the electromagnetic flowmeters were only DC magnetic field. However,
they would only work for a short time, as the fluid is conducting (maybe salt
water), the electrodes would become polarized, create deposits of the
material and after a certain time, the resistance would increase a lot and
generate some electrochemical reaction.
Second, as there are some polarization effects, let’s try to change the
magnetic field with a sinus of 50Hz, with coils of course.
Polarization is solved but the voltage generated by the wire even with still
fluids could be much higher than the one that needs to be measured. I was
acting a bit like a transformer. Thus, there was too much interference.
Third, let’s try a square wave field. Then, we have a changing DC magnetic
field. We rule out the problem of the transformer. Unfortunately, magnetic
fields changing instantaneous provoke a change of flux, which leads to noise
and interference on the voltage.
The solution is to have a trapezium magnetic field. This only came as the
electronics improved. The magnetic field slowly changes to cover the
transitions of the flux, then the measurement only needs to happen in the
tops.
