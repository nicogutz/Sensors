Regenerative breaking

This is one of the biggest advantage of electric motors. In this drawing (a) we
see the situation we have before, we are driving the motor at a constant
torque and angular velocity. Thus, the machine (i.e. a car) just moves
forward at a constant speed.
The idea behind regenerative breaking is to slow down the motor, so we
reverse the torque but the speed of the motor stays in the same direction,
because it does not instantaneously change. There is too much mechanical
inertia.
The torque can be changed because we can change the direction of the
current (which requires a very short time to happen). We reverse the current
and the torque changes direction, but the speed is still at the same direction.
If we look at the model, we want a current to become negative.
How can we do this if the back-emf cannot change quickly? With the applied
voltage. This means that we can make the applied voltage lower than the
back-emf. In that case, the current will reverse, going from the back-emf to
the battery.

This leads us to this very important slide. It tells us that we can have 4
operating modes depending on the direction of the angular speed and the
torque. So, with the horizontal axis presenting the torque and the vertical
axis as the angular speed, we have 4 possible situations in the system. And
we can play with them independently. If we have a positive torque and an
angular speed and move forward. We can also have both negative, for
moving in the reverse direction (in this case both voltage and current are
negative), like for a car in reverse. But we can also use the motor as a
generator. Mechanical energy going to the electrical system.

One final thing to talk about. This is a very insightful detail. A motor typically
has a rated Torque and speed (the maximum that they can exert), related to
current and voltage. Normally, we work below the rated torque and speed.
Now, there is a trick for some motors, where we can go above that rated
speed by using the trick of flux weakening. What does that mean? In the
back-emf we have a dependency on the flux, meaning that what we can
weaken the flux.
Do you think this works in all types of motors? We can remember we had
permanent magnet motors and field winding motors. No, for motors with a
permanent magnet this would not work because we cannot replace the
magnet. But if we have stator currents, we can reduce the currents, it
changes the machine constant and then we could have a higher speed for
the same voltage. So, we can increase the speed by the same voltage. Only
not going beyond the maximum torque.
The problem is that we will also lose some torque by reducing the magnetic
field.

Sneak Preview: Power Processing Unit

This is something that will be discussed in two lectures. We keep talking
about the applied voltage. Here we can see the type of electrical system that
generates it. In fact, we will use PWM (pulse width modulation) to control the
applied voltage and therefore the speed.
10
Electronically Commutated Motor (ECM) Drive
Or Brushless DC
11
In a brushlessDC mode we do nothave brushes. We commutate
electronically.
Here we canseethecross-sectionof themotor.
First, we canhave a look at therotor wherewe canseea permanent magnet
in therotor. We willalwayshave a magnetin therotor of a brushlessDC
motor. As you rememberfrom thepreviouslecture, youdo notneeda
permanent magneton thestator but youcanusewindingsthatcreatethe
magneticfield. In anECM thereis alwaysa permanent magnetbut itis in the
rotor. Whatdoes thismean? Thatthemagnetmoves. In thisdrawingthe
rotor is in theinside, but pleasenotethatitcanalsobein theoutside. Also
themagnetis representedbya southpoleanda northpole, in practiceyou
canhave 4, 6 or 8 poles.
So, tosummup, thereis a permanent magnetin therotor but no currents.
The currentsare onlyin thestator (representedbytheconductors)
Now, in a brushlessmotor thereare threephases: In thefiguretheyare
namedas: 1 –a anda´; 2-b andb´; and3-c andc´.
We couldsay thatthreeverylong conductors are deployedon thestator.
Eachphasehas itsownplaceor positionin thestator. In thiscase, a has the
upperandbottom60 degrees, b has thetop right andbottomleftandphase
c has thebottomright andtop left.
Keep in mind thatalltheconductors of onephaseare in series, sotheycarry
thesamecurrent. For instance, a currentia goesinsidethroughoneof the
conductors of thephase, comesout throughtheotherside andback in
throughthesecond conductor of theside a, etc.
Thus, thecurrentgoesback andforthover theshaftof themotor andgoes
out at theotherside. As theconductors are in series, theycarrythesame
currentwhichcanbeconsidereda DC currentandpositiveat oneinstant or
constant andnegativedependingon thedirection.
11
So, howdo we make therotor rotate? Bymeans of aninteraction
betweenthemagneticfield of therotor andthestator windings.
11
ECM Drive model: How does the rotor rotate?
12
Here we seethemodel of thestator. First, we canseethethreephasesof
thestator whichare connectedin a Wye-configuration(onlyoneend of the
threephasesis connected). We first seeinductorsbecausethewindings
have inductivebehaviour.
We canalsoseea simplifiedcircuit of theelectronics connectedtothethree
phases. For eachphasewe seea switch. In thenext lecturewe willlearn
thatforeachswitch we needtwotransistors andtwodiodes, but fornowitis
ok toknowthattheyare switches. For eachof themwe canseetheycanbe
eitherup or down sowe canconnectthedifferent partsof thecircuit.
Let´sseea possiblepathforthecurrent:
1. The currentstarts at thecapacitor (thetemporarystorage of energy).
Currentleavestheplus andgoesin throughtheminus of thecapacitor.
2. Second, we assumethatswitch a is closedupwards. As such, the
currentfollowstheupperpart of thecircuit, goesthroughthea wire
(whereia is shown) andarrivestophasea. Thismeans thatthecurrent
goesthroughalltheconductors of thestator. Thisis a DC current.
3. Third, thecurrentcouldsplit betweentheothertwophases, but let´s
assumethattheswitch connectedtob is open andhas no contact, but
theotherone(connectedtoc) is actuallyconnected(toground). In that
case, thecurrentwillflow throughphasec.
4. Thenthecurrentgoestogroundandback tothecapacitor. As such, the
pathis closed.
As we canseein thedrawing, therewillalwaysbetwophasesactivated
whileonephaseis notused. Thisis verytypicalforbrushlessDC motors.
Nowthequestion is: Whenshouldwe activateeachcoil? In theexamplewe
are usinga andc but sometimesitwillbeb andc, thuschangingthe
direction. The trick is tochange thedirectionin theright moment, knowing
thepositionof thepermanent magnetin therotor. Thatis whywe canseea
12
shaftpositionsignalconnectedhere. In brushlessDC we have a sensor
abletotellthepositionof therotor. Dependingon theangle, twoof the
threephaseswillbeactivated.

13
Beforewe jumpintowhichphasestoactivatewhen, let´sdiscussaboutthe
back-emf. In a brushlessDC motor, a voltage willbereturnedbythemotor
irrespectiveof the currentapplied. Thismeans thateven ifthecurrentis
zero (no connectedphase) therewillbea voltage. Whyis that? We canlook
at thetwoconductors shownin thefigure. Supposethatthemagnetis
moving. As themovingmagnetis a change in magneticfield, theconductors
willexperienceitandbecauseof Faraday therewillbea voltage generated.
Important: Whilethisis theotherway aroundconfigurationthanthe
traditional DC motor; but itdoes notchange anything.
So, howdo we calculatetheback-emf?
So, we start frome = B.l.u, whereB is theflux densityof themagneticfield, l
is thelengthof themotor andu is therelativespeed.
Nowwe canlook at figurec. Iftherotor is movingcounter clockwise, the
conductor has a relativespeed totheright. Now, thisspeed u correspondsto
rw. Thisis thevoltage accrossoneconductor.
Per phasewe have manyconductors. So, in phasea, we willhave 2Ns
conductors (Ns is numberof windings).
Nowas youmightrememberfromthepreviousslide, thereare always2
phasesactivatedat thesametime (a andc in thepreviousexample). Thus,
we needtoaddthemas theyare goingtobein series andtheconductor will
seethesumof them.
Now, fromhere we canseethatallthevaluesare constant, sotheyfit in the
formulaof themachine constant. Just like whatwe have seenbefore, the
back-emfis proportionaltotheangularspeed.
Now, andthisis important, thevoltage is unfortunatelynotconstant. It is only
constant ifalltheconductors seethesameside of themagnetallthetime as
itwillbeexplainednext.
13
Back-emf in the 3 phases (1)
14
Now, thisslide shows theback-emfon eachphaseas a functionof the
positionof therotor. Whatwe seeis thatwithina certainanglerange, the
voltage is constant, then, thereis a transitionphasewherethevoltage
changes andthenitis constant but negative. Let´sstart withtheconstant
areas, whenpositive, thepositionof themagnetis zero degrees, whileitis
negativewhenitis 180. Negativemeans thatthenorthpoleis in thesouth
polepositionandthatthedirectionof themagneticflux has changed. Why
do we have thetransitions?

In thisfigurefirst we have thereferenceconditionof zero degrees. South

We have theback-emf, nowlet´stalk abouttorque. First, thereis anerror on
thebook(markedin red). The directionof thecurrentshouldbeoutwards
making thelocalmagneticfield counter-clockwise.
How do we calculatetheforce? Lefthand rule(fbi): currentgoesoutward,
magnetigfield (arrows) goesdown sotheupperconductor feelsa force to
theleft. Same forthelowerconductor, thefemgoesin theoppositedirection.
For oneconductor, we canapplythefirst basic rule(B.I.L).
These conductors are in thestator, sotheywillnotmove. Thereis Newton’s
postulate. ¨It saysthatforeveryforce in theuniversethereis anequalbut
oppositeforce somewhereelse¨. Now, itis thatopositeforce thatwe have to
look at. Ifthemagnetpushes theconductor totheright, theconductor will
push themagnettotheleft. Thisis whatwe seein thegreen arrows: the
equalbut oppositeforce totheonein theconductor. Theyare thereaction.
Let’sdo somemath:
For oneconductor we have bli. For 2Ns in onephaseassumingthateachof
themgetsthesamecurrentandthesamemagneticfield, i.e., theyshould
seethesamemagneticfield. Thenwe canaddthemup. As we are lookingat
Torque, we multiplybytheradius. If we have twophases(alwaystwophases
are active). In thatcase, itdoubles. Again, theconclussionis thattorqueis
proportionaltocurrent. Controlling thecurrentwe cancontrol thetorque. We
have back-emfandtorque, howdo we select theright phasesat theright
time?

18
These drawings look very similar to the back-emf ones but this is torque.
First, do not be confused, that is not how torque varies as we actually want a
torque that is constant in time.
These graphs show how the torque would work if we were to send a
constant current the whole time. So, if there were always a current during the
whole rotation, the torque would go down and up. In the dash line we see
what the torque would look like if the current were reverse. As such, we
would reverse the torque.
However, we will not send a current continuously through one of the phases.
With the purpose of a constant torque, for each position we need to select
two phases. Let’s check two examples:
1. At zero degrees we have phase a activated, in phase b a transition starts,
and phase c is in reverse (high torque). Thus, between zero and 60
degrees, we select phases a and c to make sure the torque is constant.
2. For the next 60 degrees, phase a goes into transition, so we would select
phase b and continue with phase c.
This results on the three plots below, which show when the current is
activated through each of the phases. This is why we need sensors, to
understand in which position we are in.
Between adjacent phases, there is typically a phase that switches and one
that keeps constant.

19
So, again, why do we have the trapezoidal shapes?
At zero degrees all the currents in the top are seeing a south pole and all the
ones at the bottom see a north pole. So, the torque is constant.
At 60 degrees nothing changes, all the forces contribute
But, at 90 degree, if we would still send a current through that phase, some
conductors would get a view of a north pole and others the one of a south
one, cancelling out each other.
So, when we are transitioning, the phase should be switched off.
19

(4) 180 - 240 - No +
(5) 240- 300 No - +
(6) 300- 360 + - No
20
Between 0 and 60 degrees we will send a constant current through a and a
constant current through c. Where the current through a is considered
positive (it goes toward the center) and the current through c is considered
negative (it goes out of the center)
From 60 degrees: a starts transitioning so we switch it off and we activate b
with a positive current and we keep c with a negative one
120-180 degrees: c transitions, b is kept on and a is activated but negative,
changing the direction of the current
180-240 degrees: b transitions, a is kept on (-) and c is activated and positive
240-300 degrees: a transitions, b is activated negativeand c is kept positive
300-360 degrees: c transitions, b is kept negative and a is activated positive
And we reconnect to 0 degrees. Important that each phase is active through
120 degrees.
20
Torque ripple
21
Onemore thing. We have been discussingtheprocedure withthethree
switches, oneof themis up, theotheris down andthethirdoneis
disconnected. Thisis trueifwe want tohave maximum speed at alltimes.
But, as we explainedbefore, thisis notreallythecase as we willwant to
regulatethespeed bymeans of theinput voltage. Todo so, we willusePWM
tocontrol thevoltage. Thismeans thattheswitches switch at a veryfast
speed tocontrol theaveragevoltage betweena certainrange. As a result,
thecurrentwillhave a mild rippledbehaviour. Duetotheinductiveessence,
thecurrentnever goestozero but itwillexperiencesmall variations.
