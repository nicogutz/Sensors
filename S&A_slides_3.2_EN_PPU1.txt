Overview of Power Processing Units (PPU)

What you see over here is an schematic of the system used to drive a motor.
At the left side we have the utility
At the right side the load which includes the motor.
One important thing is that whether we have a DC or an AC machine, we will
always make a conversion to DC voltage. This is what we see in the middle.
The capacitor Vd. This means that conv 1 converts a possible AC voltage
into DC voltage.
In this lecture and the next, we will discuss the converter 2. This starts from
a DC voltage (Vd) and converts it to the signal needed for the motor.
As you remember from the previous lecture, we will need this converter to
create any voltage (even negative ones as in the case that we want to drive
backwards). So, let’s start from an example that I showed last lecture.
5
How does Conv 2 look like?
Typical pattern:
1. 𝑇(cid:2878)on, 𝑇(cid:2879)on
(cid:3002) (cid:3003)
2. 𝑇(cid:2878)on, 𝑇(cid:2878)on

3. 𝑇(cid:2878)on, 𝑇(cid:2879)on
(cid:3002) (cid:3003)
4. 𝑇(cid:2879)on, 𝑇(cid:2879)on
(cid:3002) (cid:3003)
6
What we see here is the converter circuit that we already saw in the previous
lecture and that we will use to drive a DC motor. We see the line voltage, the
ac to dc rectifier (conv1 in the previous slide) and the capacitor Vd.
The main function from the capacitor is to keep the voltage constant.
The current can fluctuate but the voltage needs to stay constant.
Finally, we see the full bridge (Conv 2). It consists of 4 transistors and 4
diodes in 2 switching power poles. The diodes are there to make sure that
there is always a path for the current. This is needed because we are driving
an electric motor which has inductive behavior. Inductive behavior means
that the current does not change quickly, so there is a need for a safety path
for the current. For now, we can ignore the pwm, we will talk about it later.
Finally, what we see at the end of the figure is the model of the motor. We
keep it general as for a DC motors.
Now about the transistors. We have two poles of transistors (TA and TB).
One important fact: we can never have the two TAs or the two TBs closed at
the same time or we would have a short-circuit. Thus, in practice there will
always be one transistor in pole A and one in pole B connected. Now we can
see a typical sequence of switching. First, the upper left transistor (A+) and
the bottom right transistors (B-) are on and the other two are off. Let’s revisit
those 1 by 1 to show the path for the current.
6
T + on, T - on (S2)
A B
7
In this situation, we have TA+ and TB-on. How does the current go?
First, it starts at the capacitor, the current flows from –to +. DC currents can
go through capacitors, not electrons but currents. Why is that? For every
electron entering the capacitor an electron leaves from the other side
allowing the current to flow.
Now the current leaves the capacitor, goes to the right, and it sees two
diodes that are reversed, and TB+ that is off. So, it only has one path
through TA+.
As TA-is off, so there is only one possibility for the current, it goes to the
motor. It provides the necessary torque for the load and we have a closed
loop when the current comes out of the motor.
It sees that TB-is on so it follows this path and flows back to the capacitor.
If we have this situation on the whole time, we drive the motor at full speed.
Because what we do is that Vdgoes to the motor. But it will not but the case
at all times so we will need ways to reduce the voltage provided by the
motor.
7
T + on, T + on (S1)
A B
8
Now, the two upper transistors are on. What is the path of the current?
Let’s start from the assumption that due to the inductive behavior there is a
current in the motor. Thus, we start with the current flowing from TA+ to the
motor and back from it.
As the two –transistors and diodes are switched off, the current cannot go to
ground.
There could be two possible path BUT the transistor is the wrong direction,
and the current needs to go from emitter to collector and not the other way
around. So, the only possibility is the diode.
The current continues through the diode and through transistor TA+ so we
have a closed loop.
8
T + on, T - on (S2)
A B
9
Now we go back to situation 1. It is important to note that the speed of the
switching is very high. Unlike the previous situation in this one we have a
current coming from the power supply. Thus, there no continuous current
from the power supply, but there is a continuous current from the motor.
9
T - on, T - (s3)
A B
10
Finally, we go to the last situation, where the lower two transistors are on.
Again, we have the situation were there is a current from the motor. So, how
will it continue?
As transistor TB- is on, it will go through the transistor to the ground. It will
not return to the power supply because there is no path for it.
Thus, it will continue through the diode.
From this situation we go back to situation 1. This sequence of
configurations is very common where the transistors will be switched on and
off at very high speed. The speed will determine the voltage provided to the
motor.
10
Transition Sequence
S3
S1
S2
11
This is a typical transition sequence between these three situations. We start
from the upper A transistor on and the lower transistor B on, then the current
comes from the power supply to the motor. Then, we can switch to the
situation where the two upper transistors are on. The current is already
flowing through the motor and it does not go back to the capacitor. As
alternative we could go to the two transistors off. As such, the motor is either
getting the full voltage of the power supply or nothing. How do we do the
switching? Using PWM!
11
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
12
The trick of the regulation of the voltage is PWM. Look at the voltage at the
entrance of the motor Va. We want to generate a certain average voltage at
Va. PWM switches from all voltage to nothing as such that the average Va
becomes the desired voltage. The desired voltage will be defined then by the
duty cycle (i.e., the ratio of time that the switch is connected to the power
supply within the switching period).

(cid:3021)
(cid:3268)
13
Here at the left we have the dc power supply and the switch that has a
certain duty cycle. On the top right we see a switching interval Ts (40-50
micro seconds) and the time that the switch is on (Tup). Translated into the
previous circuit a 1 means that the upper transistor is switched on, a 0
means that the lower transistor is switched on.
So, if the upper transistor is switched on, then the voltage at vais equal to
vd. If the lower transistor is on, then we are at 0 voltage. But the important
thing is that the average voltage is constant.
Let’s talk equations! What is the duty cycle? The duty cycle is the time that
the upper transistor is up Tup divided by the total duration of the switching
interval. Then the average voltage is equal to the duty ratio times the input
voltage. As the duty cycle goes from 0 to 1, the average voltage can go from
0 to the maximum voltage Vd.
13
Power flow through the switching power-pole
14
In this slide, the positions of diode and transistor look a bit different but they
are in parallel so it is the same and in the first example. What this slide
shows is the part of the path of the current. First, the situation in the middle
(b) the current il is positive, going to the motor. There is a current left to right
meaning that if the upper transistor is on, the current goes from the supply to
the motor and if the lower transistor it on, then the current goes through the
diode. In c, we see the reverse situation il is negative, either there is a
current going to the capacitor (regenerative mode) or the car is driving in
reverse. The most important take is that you know the path of the current
and through which components it goes.
14
Bidirectional switching power pole
15
This is a very similar exercise. At the left we can see the switch, in the
middle (b) we look at the situation when the upper transistor is closed and in
c is the other way around.
15

16
Actually a switch can also be considered a transformer, where the duty cycle
is the transformer factor. As such, the equations of average voltage and
current can also be seen.
16
How do we implement PWM?

17
There are different ways of implementing PWM.
Nowadays it is possible to implement PWM by means of software in a
microcontroller which opens and closes logic gates.
But the most traditional one and explained in the book is through analogue
signals. This is the situation we see in this slide. On top we have a triangular
wave that has a certain frequency (i.e., the switching frequency -10-40 KHz).
This triangular wave has also an amplitude vtri.
The voltage of that wave is compared to a control voltage (vctrl), which is
either constant (DC motors) or sinusoidal (AC motors) but at a much lower
frequency (10Hz-50Hz). If the voltage of the control is lower than the
triangular voltage, the switch is on. On the other hand, if the controller
voltage is higher the switch is off.
Let’s see the equations: The average voltage vais the duty cycle times Vd.
The duty cycle is calculated as Vctrlover the Vtri(the amplitude). Now, we
can change the order of Vdand the control voltage because Vdand the
amplitude of Vtriare constants. Their ratio is actually the pwmconstant.
Thus, we end up with the final formula. This means that our average voltage
is just the control voltage times a constant. This constant is relatively very big
(Vdis the order of 100 V) so it can be considered an amplification. In fact, a
PWM has been called as a non-linear amplifier and we will use it to model
the power supplies in the next chapters.
17
PWM block diagram
18
So, like we were saying, the system can be represented as a block diagram
which shows what the PWM does to convert a relatively low voltage into a
very high one that will be input to our motor.
18
PPUs for DC and AC motors
19
On the left side we see the situation for a DC motor. In the right one, we see
the situation for an AC motor because we need 3 phases. Each of these
switches is composed by two transistors and two diodes. For most of the
cases we focus on the situation on the left (DC) and in next lecture we will
add some things on the AC case.

At the left, we see two switches instead of one. Remember that every switch
consists of two transistors and two diodes. As we have two power poles (a
and b), how do we choose the two duty ratios?
There is an extra additional degree of freedom, because obtaining vofrom a
and b can be done in different ways.
The most typical path to take to achieve this is shown in b.
In it, we first calculate a voltage that needs to go through each pole. We start
from a common mode for both poles (half way of the power supply). This
means vd/2 in both a and b. Plus the desired voltage over two at node a
minus the desired voltage over two at node b. Therefore, we can have the
following equations.
First, vais equal to half the input voltage plus half the desired voltage.
Second, vbis half the input voltage minus half of the desired voltage.
Finally, v0 is the difference between node a and node b. This means that the
vois the difference between the duty cycles at a and b.
For example, if Vdis 100V and we want a desired voltage of 50 V. We will
have 50V for common voltage plus 25 V in node a and 50 minus 25 in node
b. This means that there is 75V at node a, 25 V at node b and we have 50 V
(va-vb) across the motor (v0).

21
These are the wave forms of the previous example. 2 switches = 2 control
voltages. What we see here are the instantaneous voltages. As explained
before, we supply in all the possible paths is an all or nothing (the full
voltage or 0 V).
At the bottom we see the instantaneous voltage that is applied to the motor
and we end up with an average voltage as we calculated before.
There is one advantage to this approach: accuracy. We could for instance
close the transistors of one pole all the time and only work with the other
pole, but the advantage of playing with two poles is that we have a
seemingly higher switching speed. The advantage of a higher switching
speed is accuracy. The average voltage is more accurately obtained as there
are some possible fluctuations in the current. There is a disadvantage:
efficiency. Every time we switch we need to turn on/off a transistor we have
some power loss. There needs to be a trade off.
Now about the speed of the switch of the motor, we see that the motor
seems to be switching twice as fast than a and b. This is an advantage of
this approach as well.
Now we can link these figures to the first figure we showed at the beginning
of the lecture.
• From 0 to the first db.Ts/2, both a and b are on (qa=qb= 1). This means
that their upper transistors are up, there is no current from the power
supply to the motor and we apply no voltage across the motor (S1).
• The second situation can be found next. Qa= 1 but qb= 0 this means that
the upper transistor of A is on and the lower transistor in b is on. This
means that there is maximum voltage across the motor.
• Same way, when a and b are off, there is again no voltage across the
motor (S3).
21
Let’s look at the current
𝑖 = 𝑑 .𝑖(cid:3365)
(cid:3031)(cid:3028) (cid:3028) (cid:2868)
𝑖 = −𝑑 .𝑖(cid:3365)

𝑖(cid:3365) = 𝑖 + 𝑖 = 𝑑 − 𝑑 .𝑖
(cid:3031) (cid:3031)(cid:3028) (cid:3031)(cid:3029) (cid:3028) (cid:3029) (cid:2868)
22
We have talked quite a lot about the voltages, let’s now look at the currents.
We see here how all the currents are defined but let’s try to find the relation
between all of them. If you remember, we are considering the power poles as
transformers so the current going through the first switch for the left power
pole is duty ratio times the current that the motor needs. So, while the io
current is continues (there is always a current running through the motor) ida
is intermittent and a fraction of it. No problem for a capacitor. Same for b.
Why do we have a minus sign? We can see it from the figure. If the b switch
is closed, the current goes in the other direction of the io, from there the
minus sign. Now, if we combine them, we have the relation between the
input current and the motor current.
