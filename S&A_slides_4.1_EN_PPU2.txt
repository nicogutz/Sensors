First, we are going to go through an exercise similar to the one you will have
to work on during the exam.
Here is the data:
• Vdis 350V is the voltage of the power supply (across the capacitor and
constant).
• Eais 236 Vdc this is the back-emf, thus, it says something about the
speed of the motor (which we could calculate if we knew the machine
constant).
• The average current at the motor is 4A, which again is related to the
torque (if we knew the machine constant we could calculate it).
• Fs is the switching frequency, it is the frequency at which the transistors
will switch. This is the frequency of the triangular wave (the period of the
triangular wave is 50micro s).
• Ra is the equivalent resistor of the motor model (50 ohm) (the resistance
of the windings of the motor).
• The amplitude of the triangular wave is 1V
• And the ripple of the motor current is 1 A.

We could get a figure like this in which the missing values need to be filled
in. Let’s try to see what we need to calculate and how to do it. Fist, we are
asked for the average output voltage. Why average? Because the
instantaneous values will be either Vd(350V) or 0. Moreover, we are asked
to calculate the control voltage values. These three values can be calculated
from the steady state where nothing changes. Thus, a DC analysis would
suffice. The next three values relate to the instantaneous changes in the
voltage meaning that we will need to analysein AC (i.e., with an analysis of
the inductor), finally the average id, is again DC analysis. Thus, how do we
tackle this exercise?

The first thing we do is to split the analysis between DC and AC analysis. In
the DC analysis the inductor does not affect (steady state, no changes in the
current), while in the AC analysis we will have the vo,ripplewith will
correspond to the voltage that falls into the inductor. Now, let’s try to first
analysethe DC situation.

In the DC analysis, we have the motor model just represented by the resistor
and the back-emf but no representation of the inductance.
Why can we ignore the inductor? Because there is no average voltage
around the inductor, if there was one the current would keep increasing. If we
know that the current is on average constant, then there is no effect on the
inductor. In other words, we could say that the impedance is jwL, omega is 0,
then we can ignore the inductor.
So, we know the average current, we know the back-emf so we can
calculate the average vo= 238 V. Based on it, we can calculate the voltage
we need to apply to each power pole. We need to calculate two pwmsignals.
If we have a look at what we just saw on the summary, we have that the
voltage on power pole a is 294V and a duty ratio of 0.84. On the other pole,
the b voltage is 56 V and a duty ratio of 0.16. And the sum of both is 1.

So, lets check the signals on the wave forms. First, we say that vois 238 V
as we can see in 1. Then as we know the duty ratios for a and b, we have a
v control a of 0.84V and a v control b of 0.16V.
Now we will do an AC analysis. AC analysis means we will look at the high
switching speeds that we have

What we have here again is the motor model with the 50 ohm resistor and
the inductor that we cannot ignore this time, and the back-emf. The back-emf
is very stable, it cannot change quickly. Why is that? Because it is
determined by the speed of the motor and the speed of the motor cannot
change quickly. It is a mechanical thing. Also the voltage across the resistor
can be considered constant and 2V. Now, the voltage that we apply at v0 is
on average 238V but now we want to look at instantaneous values.

If 𝑣 = 350𝑉, then 𝑣 = 112𝑉 (current will increase)
(cid:3042) (cid:3013)
If 𝑣 = 0𝑉, then 𝑣 = −238𝑉 (current will decrease)
(cid:3042) (cid:3013)
10
Due to the PWM, some times the voltage will be 350V (the value of the Vd).
In those case, the voltage across the inductor will be 112 V. A relative high
voltage across the inductance that will provoke the current to increase. This
will be of course for a very short time. At other times the voltage will be 0 (if
both upper or lower transistors are switched on). In those cases, we have a -
238V around the inductor. Thus, the current will decrease. This is the reason
why we have the ripple.

Now we can calculate the inductor value. Let’s see which value we should
have to keep the ripple at 1 A. So what is the relation between voltage and
current at the inductor. V is equal to L di/dt. As it is linear rise or decline, it
can be approximated to delta I over delta t. So, we can either chose the
increasing or the decreasing part. So, the increment of time, is the da –db
divided by 2 multiplied by the switching frequency. So the increment of t is 17
ms.Why is that? We can find it from the figures. The ripple of the current is
1A, so the La is 1.9mH. If your motor has already this inductance inherently,
there is no need to add an extra inductor, if not, it can be added. Does it hurt
to add an inductor? Not really, it will just be there to reduce the ripple of the
current.
12
Synthesis of low-frequency AC
13
So, now, let’s talk about AC signals. We have a few more slides on AC
signals. First of all, how do we generate a sine wave with PWM? By having a
very high switching speed compared to the one of the sine wave.
Thus, we can switch very veryfast. If the instantaneous value is high, you
have a pwmsignal with a very high duty ratio, if the instantaneous value is
low, you have a signal with a very small duty ratio. So, the duty ratio changes
up and down very fast to create the sinusoidal.
Moreover, we should keep in mind that the average voltage of the sine wave
is not zero. It is not possible, as we cannot have a negative duty ratio. The
offset is again half of the power supply. If the voltage is 350V, the offset DC
component will be 175V. Again, the sine waves are gotten from the
electronics, not from the power supply.
13
Three-phase converters
14
In general, we will have a 3-phase systems for AC motors and for ECM DC
motors. In this case we will have 3 power poles instead of 2 (a, b, c). In each
of them we will generate a sinusoid, by having the duty ratio varying. What
we see at the other end of figure a is the inductor representing the inductive
behavior of the motor (we will also have the resistor, but it is not represented
there) and the back-emf which will have a sinusoidal behaviour. This means
that the amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidalswill determine the speed
of the motor. We will cover this more in detail in the next lectures.
Why is the figure in a not completely representative of ECM motors? There
we also have three phases a, b and c but the generated voltage is constant
when the phases are used. Like in the two poles case, the three poles can
be modelled as transformers.
14
Switching-cycle averaged output voltages for 3-phase
15
Now, how do we represent the voltages? We see here the common voltage
which is half of the power supply and on top of that we have the sinusoidal
voltage created by pwm. We will not get into the details of the equations for
this case. This also means that the questions in the exam will not be in depth
on this regard.
15
Switching-cycle averaged voltage due to Sine-PWM
16
What we see here is how the 3 sinusoids vary on top of each other. We will
discuss this more in depth when we talk about AC motors. This is a very
typical pattern, where the three frequencies are identical amplitude but with a
phase shift of 120 degrees. This shows that these duty ratios are not fully
independent from each other, but that there is some dependance or relation.
16
Switching waveforms
17
In the duty ratios we will be able to see something like this. We need to keep
in mind that this is a picture that we take at 1 instance in time. The duty
ratios will vary at high speed to build the sinusoidal shapes and at some
moment in time will look like this.

Any questions?
