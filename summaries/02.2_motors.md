## Session 2.2: Introduction to Motors and DC Motors
### Maria Torres Vega, Faculty of Engineering Technology

### Previously on Sensors & Actuators
- **Basic Principles of Operation**
  1. Current-carrying conductor + externally established magnetic field = electromagnetic force: 
     $\[
     f = B \cdot i \cdot l
     \]$
  2. Conductor moving in a magnetic field results in back-emf: 
     $\[
     e = B \cdot l \cdot u
     \]$

### Today's Session Overview
- **Topics:**
  - Motor classification and examples
  - DC Motors structure
  - Operating principles of DC Motors
  - DC Motor Model and steady state
  - Four quadrant operation

### Motor Types
- AC Motors
  - Induction motor (asynchronous)
  - Permanent magnet AC motor (synchronous)
  - Brushless DC motor (ECM drive)
  
- DC Motors
  - Classic DC motor (brushed)
  - Induced magnetic field via field winding (for higher power)

### Cost Distribution for DC and AC Drives
- DC motors are generally more expensive due to safety regulations but require less complex electronics. However, due to advances in cheaper electronics, AC motors are becoming more popular, especially in applications like electric cars.

### Structure of a DC Machine
- Components:
  - **Stator:** Contains either permanent magnets or field windings.
  - **Rotor:** Rotates and contains conductors moving in a magnetic field, activated by brushes which connect to the power supply and facilitate current flow.
  - Note on brushes: They wear out over time and can create sparks requiring safety measures.

### Operating Principles of DC Machines: 
#### 1. Flux Generation
- The magnetic field produced by the stator (permanent magnets or field winding) influences current through the rotor via brushes.

#### 2. Torque Generation
- Torque is generated as current flows through the rotor conductors, causing rotational motion. Commutation is necessary to ensure current continues to flow in a direction that sustains torque.

#### 3. Voltage and Current Behavior
- Voltage and current polarities in conductors reverse as the rotor moves, leading to a momentarily zero torque due to electrical shortcuts during commutation.

### Methodologies to Reduce Current Shortcuts
- Incorporating multiple conductors and staggered commutation reduces the impact of shortcuts, maintaining torque and voltage stability.

### DC Motor Equations
1. Torque:
   $\[
   T = k \cdot i
   \]$
2. Induced Voltage:
   $\[
   e = k \cdot \omega
   \]$
3. Machine model relates electrical inputs to mechanical outputs, using concepts from circuit theory.

### Armature Reaction & Compensation
- The combined magnetic fields from both the stator and rotor can alter torque dynamics. Compensation mechanisms exist but are not the focus of this course.

### DC Motor Model
- The DC motor can be described by a few essential equations:
  - Kirchhoff's relationship between applied voltage, induced voltage, resistance, and inductance.
  - The back-emf ($\( e \)$) is related to motor speed ($\( \omega \)$).
  - Torque ($\( T \)$) is proportional to current ($\( i \)$).
  - Angular acceleration is a function of net torque and inertia.

### Steady State of the DC Motor
- In steady state, parameters reach equilibrium where applied voltage balances with back-emf and voltage drops across resistances.

### DC Motor Characteristics
- The relationship between torque and speed is illustrated by characteristic curves which depict how applied voltage and load affect motor performance.

### Exercise
1. **Given Data:**
   - Resistance ($\( R \)$) = 0.35 Î©
   - Torque constant ($\( k \)$) = 0.5 Nm/A
   - For a torque ($\( T \)$) of 8 Nm, plot steady-state torque-speed at $\( V = 100V \)$.

2. **Calculations:**
   - Rate of speed at $\( 0 \)$ torque for applied voltage leads to a calculated $\( \omega \)$ of $\( 200 \)$ rad/s.
   - The voltage drop at different torques can be analyzed based on current related to the torque and resistance.

### Conclusion
Understanding the principles of motor operation, particularly DC motors, allows for effective application and control in electrical engineering and automation. This session provided foundational knowledge critical for further studies in the field.
