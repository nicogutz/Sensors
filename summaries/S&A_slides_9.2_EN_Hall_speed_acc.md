## Hall Effect Sensors

### Introduction
- Hall effect sensors are inexpensive and compact devices that detect a magnetic field.
- Unlike inductive coil-based sensors, Hall sensors can detect a magnetic field without movement.

### Working Principle
- A Hall sensor operates by generating a voltage proportional to the magnetic field (not dependent on the rate of change).
- Requires current to create a magnetic field, following Ampere's law.

### Structure and Behavior
- Typically integrated circuits that cost around 1 euro.
- Operate at excitation voltages of 3-6 V, providing a linear output: higher magnetic field yields higher output voltage.

### Applications
1. **Industrial Applications**: Detect rotation of shafts using magnets placed on the shaft.
   - RPM Measurement: Through counting pulses generated as magnets approach the sensor.
2. **Gear Position Detection**: Using ferromagnetic gears.
   - Changes in magnetic field detected as teeth and valleys pass by the Hall sensor.

### Enhanced Applications
- Differential Hall Sensor: Utilizes two Hall sensors to improve detection of gear positions and directions.

### Advanced Configurations
- **Angular Hall Bridge**: Chip with four Hall sensors for absolute position detection in rotating shafts.

## Ultrasonic Sensors
- **Principle**: Uses piezoelectric crystals to generate and receive ultrasonic waves.
- **Measurement**: Calculates distance based on time delay of emitted pulse.
- **Limitations**: Affected by environmental factors (temperature, humidity) and reflective surface characteristics.

## Velocity Sensors

### Introduction
- Velocity sensors measure movement over time and can be categorized based on speed ranges:
  - Slow (<1Hz) - Displacement
  - Medium (<1KHz) - Velocity
  - Fast (>1KHz) - Acceleration

### Measurement Techniques
- Mean Velocity: Calculated by measuring displacement over time; however, it can be misleading in varying conditions.
- Momentary velocity is more accurate when changes are fast.

### Types of Velocity Sensors
1. **Tachometers**: Measure voltage generated by wires moving in a magnetic field. 
   - **DC Tachometers**: Generate voltage proportional to angular velocity.
   - **AC Tachometers**: Generate AC voltage with amplitude proportional to speed.

2. **Variable Reluctance Speed Sensor**: 
   - Induces voltage based on the proximity of a target feature (like a gear tooth) to the sensor.

### Applications
- Found in systems like motorcycle ABS systems to determine wheel speed.

## Acceleration Sensors

### Introduction
- Acceleration sensors must differentiate between absolute and relative acceleration.
- Gravity must be accounted for in relative acceleration measurements.

### Types of Accelerometers
1. **Seismic Accelerometers**: Measure absolute acceleration via a mass-spring system.
2. **Deflection-Type Accelerometers**: Utilize various configurations (resistive, capacitive, piezoelectric).
3. **MEMS Accelerometers**: Incorporate micro-electro-mechanical systems for compact designs.

#### Key Configurations
- **Capacitive Accelerometer**: Measures changes in capacitance due to displacement.
- **Piezoelectric Accelerometer**: Generates voltage due to dynamic changes in pressure but cannot measure static (DC) acceleration.
