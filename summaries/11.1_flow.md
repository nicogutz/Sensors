# Engineering Lecture Summary: Flow Sensors

## Session Overview
- **Topic**: Flow Sensors
- **Instructor**: Maria Torres Vega

### Contents
1. **Definition of Flow**
   - Flow (Q) is defined as the amount of cubic meters per second traveling through a pipe, applicable to gases and fluids.

2. **Types of Flow Sensors**
   - **Anemometers**: Used for measuring air flow.
   - **Differential Pressure Flow Sensors**: Most common in industry for measuring fluids.
   - **Ultrasonic Flow Sensors**: Measure flow based on sound speed.
   - **Electromagnetic Flow Sensors**: Utilize conductive fluid properties to measure flow.

### Detailed Discussion

#### 1. Thermal Anemometers
- **Description**: A simple gas flow meter consisting of a hot wire that measures air speed. 
- **Working Principle**: 
  - The wire heats up and cools down due to air flow; the change in resistance is non-linear, requiring calibration. 
  - To improve measurement accuracy, a differential system with two hot wires is suggested: one in flow and one out of the flow.

#### 2. Variable-Pressure-Drop Meters
- **Method**: Involves placing an obstruction (sharp-edge orifice) in a pipe that creates turbulence, causing a differential pressure drop before and after the obstruction.
- **Pressure Drop Measurement**:
  - The pressure drop relates to flow rate but is non-linear due to turbulence. 
  - Formula derived: 
  $\[
  Q = A_1 \sqrt{\frac{2(P_1 - P_2)}{\rho}}
  \]$
  
- **Discharge Coefficient**: Accounts for flow characteristics and relies on the orifice to pipe diameter ratio (β). 
  - Typically stabilizes around 0.65 for high flow rates.

#### 3. Flow Nozzle, Venturi Tube, Dall Flow Tube
- These devices are designed to model fluid flow patterns more efficiently than sharp-edge orifices, yielding higher accuracy and better long-term performance.

#### 4. Differential Pressure Flow Measuring Principle
- **Laminar Flow Elements**: Used for gas flow with a mesh structure that maintains laminar flow while allowing for pressure drop measurements.

#### 5. Ultrasonic Flow Sensors
- **Technology**: Utilizes the transit time of sound bursts between two points to measure the flow rate. 
- **Application**: Effective for sensitive measurements like blood flow without obstruction.

#### 6. Electromagnetic Flow Meters
- **Operating Principle**: Measures voltage generated when a conductive fluid moves through a magnetic field.
- **Setup**: Requires a non-metallic pipe and electrodes to prevent short-circuiting.
  
- **Conductivity Requirement**: The fluid must be conductive (minimum conductivity of 5 µS/cm) for voltage generation.
  
- **Evolution of Technology**: 
  1. **DC Magnetic Fields**: Poor performance due to polarization.
  2. **AC Sinusoidal Fields**: Reduces polarization but introduces electromagnetic interference.
  3. **Trapezium Fields**: Combines advantages of previous methods with reduced noise.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Electromagnetic Flow Meters
- **Pros**: 
   - Linear relationship between flow and voltage
   - High accuracy and large measurement range
   - No obstruction to flow
- **Cons**: 
   - High cost and complexity of electronics
