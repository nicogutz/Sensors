## Basic Understanding of Switch-Mode Power Electronics

### Overview of Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM)
- **PWM for Traditional DC Motors**
  - Equation for average voltage for the pole configurations.
  - Involves calculating voltages and currents using duty cycles $\( d \)$ related to the transistors and diodes in the switching device.

### Key Topics

2. Low frequency AC switching
3. Three-phase converters
4. Sine-PWM

## Ripple Analysis Example

### Given Parameters
- $\( V_{dis} = 350V \)$ (Power supply voltage)
- $\( E_{ais} = 236V \)$ (Back-emf, related to motor speed)
- Average motor current $\( i = 4A \)$
- Switching Frequency $\( f = 20kHz \)$ (Triangular waveform period: 50μs)
- Motor resistance $\( R = 0.5Ω \)$
- Triangular wave amplitude = 1V
- Ripple of motor current = 1A

### Analysis Steps
1. **DC Analysis**
   - Calculate average output voltage, $\( v_0 = 238V \)$.
   - Control voltage values calculated from steady state conditions.
   - Use the equation $\( v = E + R \cdot i \)$ to determine voltage across the motor.

2. **AC Analysis**
   - Analyze high switching speeds with PWM for instantaneous values.
   - Example scenarios when $\( v_d = 350V \)$ and $\( v_d = 0V \)$ leading to voltage changes across the inductor that affect current.

### AC Inductor Ripple Calculation
- Calculate inductor value to maintain the desired current ripple.
- $\( V = L \cdot \frac{di}{dt} \)$ relation used to derive inductance needed for maintaining current ripple at 1A.

## Synthesizing Low-Frequency AC 
- **Generation of Sine Waves with PWM**
  - High switching speeds can create sine waveforms through variable duty ratios reflecting the instantaneous values.
  - Average voltage of the sine wave not equal to zero; offset determined by the power supply.

### Three-Phase Converters
- In 3-phase systems, each of the three power poles generates a sinusoidal waveform.
- The relationship between the three phases and the effect on the motor speed are highlighted.

### Switching-Cycle Averaged Output Voltages
- Discusses the representation of voltages in 3-phase systems and how they relate through varying duty cycles.

### Switching Waveforms
- Illustrates how duty ratios will appear at any given time, capturing the dynamic nature of PWM signals.

**Conclusion**: The information covered in this session about PWM applications in electric drives, ripple analysis, and sine waves generation provides fundamental insights into the design and analysis of motor control systems employing switch-mode power electronics.
