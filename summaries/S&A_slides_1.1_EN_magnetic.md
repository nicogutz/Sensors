## The Motor Model
- **Components**:
  - **Resistor (Ra)**: Represents ohmic losses due to long wires in the motor. Voltage loss occurs when current passes through.
  - **Inductor (La)**: Accounts for inductive behavior where current cannot change instantaneously and requires a voltage.
  - **Voltage Source (ea)**: Represents the voltage generated by the motor, which leads to back-emf (e) proportional to angular velocity (ω).
- **Key Equations**:
  - Electrical Power: \( P_{elec} = V \cdot I \)
  - Mechanical Power: \( P_{mech} = T \cdot ω \)

## Ampere's Law
- **Definition**: States that when a current \( I \) is passed through a conductor, a magnetic field \( B \) or \( H \) is generated.
- **Right-hand Rule**: Use the thumb to indicate current direction and fingers to show magnetic field direction.

### Application to a Ring
- The magnetic field \( H \) around a ring is proportional to the current and is circular.
- The intensity of the magnetic field \( H \) can be calculated using:
  \[
  H = \frac{NI}{2 \pi r}
  \]
  where \( N \) is the number of turns and \( r \) is the radius.

## Magnetic Flux Density \( B \)
- Relationship: 
  \[
  B = \mu H
  \]
- **Permeability**: Often represented as \( \mu = \mu_0 \cdot \mu_r \) where \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space and \( \mu_r \) is the relative permeability of the material.

## Magnetic Flux \( \Phi \)
- Flux is defined as:
  \[
  \Phi = \int B \cdot dA
  \]
- For uniform fields: 
  \[
  \Phi = B \cdot A
  \]
- **Magnetomotive Force (MMF)**: Defined as:
  \[
  \text{MMF} = N \cdot I
  \]
- **Reluctance**: Represented by \( \mathcal{R} \) considers the ease with which magnetic flux passes through a material.

## Flux in Structures with Air Gaps
- **System Behavior**: In motors, air gaps exist between the rotor and stator.
- **Key Equation**:
  \[
  \Phi = \frac{\text{MMF}}{\mathcal{R}}
  \]
- Understanding that high reluctance in air gaps necessitates higher magnetic field intensity \( H \).

## Inductance
- **Definition**: The ability of a coil or loop to cause a magnetic flux linkage \( \lambda \) based on the current flowing through it.
- **Inductance Formula**:
  \[
  L = \frac{N^2 \mu A}{l}
  \]

## Inductance and Faraday's Law
- **Faraday's Law**: Describes how changing magnetic flux induces an electromotive force (emf).
  \[
  e = -N \frac{d\Phi}{dt}
  \]
- **Lenz’s Law**: Indicated that induced currents will generate magnetic fields opposing the change in flux.

## Leakage and Magnetizing Inductances
- **Definition of Leakage**: Loss of flux through unintended paths such as air gaps. It is an important consideration when modeling motors.

## Summary of Motor Model with Leakage
- Model includes both the intended flux for motor operation and the losses due to leakage.
- Illustrates how to account for efficient design to minimize leakage and ensure optimal electromotive force generation.
