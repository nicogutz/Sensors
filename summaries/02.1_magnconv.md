# Sensors and Actuators - Lecture Summary

## Session 2.1: Magnetic Circuits & Electromechanical Conversions

### Overview of Key Concepts
- Understanding the basic principles of transformers and electromechanical energy conversion.
- Discuss the motor structures and energy production principles.

### Previous Knowledge
- Knowledge of the motor model parameters: H (magnetic field intensity), B (magnetic flux density), and Φ (magnetic flux).
- Familiarity with Ampere's Law and concepts related to magnetic circuits.

### Introduction to Transformers
- **Definition**: Transformers are systems composed of two inductively coupled coils.
- Two types of windings: primary (e1) and secondary (e2).
- **Working Principle**: Applying a voltage to the primary coil induces a magnetic flux, which in turn creates a current (magnetizing current) that travels through the system.
  
### Key Equations
1. Induced voltage: 
   $\[ e = N \frac{dΦ}{dt} \]$
2. Reflected load analysis examines how the load on the secondary affects the magnetizing current on the primary side.

### Circuital Model
- Represents an ideal transformer with consideration for magnetizing inductors.
- Real transformers include factors for magnetic losses (hysteresis and eddy current losses).

### Eddy Current Losses
- Occur due to changing magnetic fields inducing currents in magnetic cores, which can result in energy loss. 
- Countered by laminating the core material to reduce loop areas and thus limit eddy currents.

### Basic Principles of Electromechanical Energy Conversion
- Motors can operate in two modes: motoring (converting electrical power to mechanical) and generating (inverse process during braking).
- **Structure of Motors**:
  - Consists of a stator (stationary part) and a rotor (rotating part) with a minimal air gap for efficiency.

### Production of Magnetic Fields
- Magnetic fields in motors are produced by coils winding in stator slots driven by applied currents.
- Ampère's Circuital Law is used to assess field strength in systems with high permeability materials.

### Fundamentals of Motor Operation
1. **Electromagnetic Force**: Produced in conductors when subjected to magnetic fields (related to Lorentz Force).
   
2. **Induced EMF**: According to Faraday’s Law, a conductor moving through a magnetic field will have voltage induced across it.

### Torque Calculation
- Torque (T) for one conductor: 
  $\[ T = B \cdot i \cdot l \cdot r \]$
- Induced voltage (E):
  $\[ E = B \cdot l \cdot r \cdot ω \]$
- For multiple conductors, these equations are scaled based on the number of turns and their arrangement.

### Power Equality
- **Ideal Case**: Electrical power equals mechanical power, expressed as $\( P_e = P_m \)$.
  
### Real-World Considerations
- Recognizes various loss sources in electrical systems and machines, including conduction, iron, and friction losses.

### Safe Operation of Motors
- Every motor has specified nominal speed and torque, critical for understanding effective operation and performance management.

### Closing Remarks
- Importance of understanding motor operation modes and ensuring systems are managed to maintain nominal performance.
