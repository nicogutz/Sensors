- **Definition of a Sensor**
- **Active vs Passive Sensors**
- **Examples of Sensors**
- **General Characteristics of Sensors**

## Sensor Definition
- A **sensor** is a device that receives a signal or stimulus and responds with an electrical signal. 
- **Signal/Stimulation Types:**
  - Position
  - Acceleration
  - Force/Pressure
  - Temperature

## Output Types
- **Active Sensors**: Require an external power source for operation and produce outputs like voltage or current.
- **Passive Sensors**: Generate outputs from ambient energy, relying on inherent physical properties such as resistance or capacitance.

## Examples of Sensors
| Sensor                 | Property         | Active/Passive | Output          | Applications                      |
|-----------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) | Position        | Active         | AC Voltage      | Machine tools, robotics, automation systems |
| Accelerometer          | Acceleration      | Active         | Capacitance     | Inertial navigation, digital cameras, drones |
| Strain Gauge           | Force/Pressure    | Active         | Resistance      | Power plants, ships, refineries   |
| Piezoelectric Sensor    | Force/Pressure    | Passive        | Charge          | Cellphones, musical greeting cards |
| Thermistor             | Temperature       | Active         | Resistance      | Digital thermometers, appliances   |

## Sensor Control Loop Example
1. Sensor measures a physical property (e.g., temperature).
2. Output signal is conditioned and digitized via an ADC.
3. Microcontroller processes data to determine if the temperature is above/below desired value and outputs a digital word to a DAC.
4. DAC output controls an actuator (e.g., heater).

## Smart Sensors
- Intelligent sensors incorporate A/D converters and microcontroller programmability for functionalities like self-calibration and linearization.
- These sensors can interface directly with industrial networks.

## General Characteristics of Sensors
### Static Characteristics
- **Transfer Function**: Describes the relationship between input and output signals.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Span (Full-Scale Input/Output)
  - Accuracy (and Inaccuracy)
  - Calibration
  - Hysteresis
  - Non-linearity
  - Saturation
  - Repeatability
  - Dead Band
  - Resolution
  - Output Impedance
  - Excitation

### Dynamic Characteristics
- Respond over time and include zero-order, first-order, and second-order sensors based on their energy storage and response dynamics.

## Static Characteristics Explained
1. **Transfer Function**: Can be linear or non-linear, defining how output changes concerning input.
2. **Full-Scale Input/Output**: The limits of the input range that the sensor can accurately measure.
3. **(In)Accuracy**: Represents the deviation from the true value the sensor measures.
4. **Calibration**: Process of defining the sensorâ€™s transfer function for accurate measurements. 

## Calibration Methods
- For linear sensors, calculate constants from voltage readings.
- Non-linear sensors may require multiple measurement points or piecewise approximations.

## Specific Static Characteristics
- **Hysteresis**: The difference in output when the input signal approaches from different directions.
- **Nonlinearity**: The maximum deviation of the actual transfer function from the expected line.
- **Saturation**: The sensor's inability to produce a correct output beyond certain input levels.
- **Repeatability**: The ability of a sensor to produce the same output under the same conditions.

## Summary of Dynamic Characteristics
- **Order of Sensor**:
  - **Zero-order**: Responds instantaneously.
  - **First-order**: Response delayed by one energy storage element.
  - **Second-order**: Involves two energy storage components.
- **Frequency Response**: Explains how different sensors behave regarding various input frequencies.

### Important Equations
- **Transfer Function**: $\( O = F(i) \)$
- **First Order Sensor**: $\( b + T O(t) = i(t) \)$
- **Second Order Sensor**: $\( b + b O(t) + b O(t) = i(t) \)$

## Conclusion
Understanding sensor characteristics and types is essential for efficient designs in engineering and technology applications. The transition from static to dynamic behavior informs their practical applications across various fields such as automation, navigation, and control systems.
