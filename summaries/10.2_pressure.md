## Pressure Sensors

### Overview
- Pressure is defined as force per unit area (F/A in N/mÂ²).
  
### Types of Pressure Measurements
1. **Absolute Pressure**: Measured relative to a perfect vacuum (0 Pa). Theoretical since it's impossible to achieve 0 Pa in practice.
2. **Gauge Pressure**: Measures pressure relative to atmospheric pressure (reference pressure set to 101.325 kPa).
3. **Differential Pressure**: Measures pressure difference between two points, commonly used in sensor technology.

### Measurement Principles
- Pressure sensors convert pressure into electrical output typically through displacement. 
- Displacement can occur in various mechanisms:
  - Membrane deflection under applied pressure.
  - Different mechanical configurations such as domes or spiral designs.
  
### Types of Pressure Sensors
1. **Piezoelectric Pressure Sensor**
   - Utilizes piezoelectric materials that generate electrical signals in response to pressure changes (works only with AC pressure).
   - Example application: Electronic stethoscopes to measure heartbeats by capturing sound vibrations.

2. **Capacitive Pressure Sensor**
   - Consists of capacitors whose values change in response to pressure on a membrane.
   - Can be designed for absolute or differential pressure measurements.

3. **Strain Gauge Pressure Sensors**
   - Employ strain gauges on membranes that deform under pressure, creating measurements based on strain.

4. **Piezoresistive Pressure Sensor**
   - Integrates strain gauges with piezoresistive materials. Resistance changes with pressure applied to the diaphragm.

5. **Optical Pressure Sensor**
   - Utilizes a membrane displacing light from an LED to measure pressure, can be used in biomedical applications because of its isolation from electronics.

## Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)

### Overview and Applications
- MEMS combines small mechanical and electrical systems to create compact sensors.
- Relevant to various applications in automotive and industrial sectors, notably in accelerometers and gyroscopes.

### MEMS Accelerometers
- Utilizes mass and springs with a capacitive displacement sensor. Movement changes the capacitance, allowing for acceleration measurements.
- Example: MEMS accelerometers in crash sensors for vehicles.

### MEMS Sensors Types
1. **Capacitive Accelerometers**: Measure longitudinal displacement.
2. **Piezoresistive Accelerometers**: Use piezoresistive materials for displacement measurements.
3. **Vibration Sensors**: Adjust sensitivity via electrostatic forces to capture vibrations effectively.

### MEMS Gyroscopes
- Measure angular velocity. Rotational movement induces Coriolis forces on proof masses, allowing for angular motion detection.

### Manufacturing and Integration
- MEMS technology allows for tiny, integrated sensor designs, often packaged in custom PCB boards for easy application in various fields.
