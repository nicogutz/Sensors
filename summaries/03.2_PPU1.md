## Overview of Power Processing Units (PPU)
- A schematic illustrating the system driving a motor. On one side is the utility, and on the opposite side is the motor load.
- All systems convert AC voltage to a DC voltage (Vd) using a rectifier (Conv 1).
- The second converter (Conv 2) converts DC voltage to the required voltage for the motor, which may include negative voltages to reverse motor direction.

### Converter Configuration
- Conv 2 consists of:
  - A capacitor (Vd) for voltage stabilization.
  - A full bridge circuit with 4 transistors and 4 diodes to ensure a current path needed for the motor's inductive characteristics.
- Important consideration to prevent short-circuits by operating only one transistor from each pole (A or B) at a time.
- Each transistorâ€™s operation sequence is critical for the motor's performance.

## Switching Sequence
The typical switching sequence in the converter includes:
- **S1:** Transistors TA+ and TB- are on.
- **S2:** Transistors TA+ and TA- are on.
- **S3:** Transistors TB- and TB+ are on.

The switches must alternate efficiently to drive the motor. Timing of the switching impacts the motor voltage and speed.

## Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
- PWM controls the average voltage sent to the motor by rapidly switching the converter's output between full voltage (Vd) and zero.
- The duty cycle defines the ratio of time that the switch is "on" compared to the total switching period.
  
  Formula:
  $\[
  v = d \cdot V
  \]$

Where $\( d \)$ represents the duty cycle.

### Implementation
- PWM can be implemented digitally via microcontrollers, or traditionally using analog methods.
- A triangular waveform is typically compared with a slower varying control voltage to determine whether the switch should be on or off, thus controlling the output voltage effectively.

### Power Flow in Switching Poles
- Diodes and transistors are arranged such that:
  - When the upper transistor is closed, current flows to the motor.
  - If the lower transistor is active, the current path will lead back through the diode to the supply.
  
## Switching Cycle Model
PWM operates under the principle that the average voltage and current delivered through the switches can be expressed as:
  
  $\[
  v = d \cdot V
  \]$
  $\[
  i = d \cdot i_{m}
  \]$

Where $\( i_{m} \)$ is the motor current.

### Bidirectional Switching
- The model allows conversion and regulation of voltages for both DC and AC motors through appropriate circuit configurations of transistors and diodes.

## Voltage and Current Control in DC Motors
- Two switches are needed to manage output across a motor using a differential approach where different duty cycles can be assigned to each controlled output.
- Desired output voltage is derived using common mode voltage and differential adjustments from duty cycles.

## Example Problem
- **Given:** Power supply $\( V = 300V \)$ and desired voltage $\( v_0 = 75V \)$.
- Calculating duty ratios involves using the voltage relationships and comparing the expected outputs to derive the correct settings for each switch.

## Conclusion and Questions
This session concludes with an invitation for any questions to ensure comprehension of the key concepts covered regarding PWM and converter configurations for electric drives.
