- **Date:** 27/10
- **Content:** Designing Feedback Controllers for Motor Drives
- **Manual:** Ac. 8 C

## Overview
The session focuses on designing feedback controllers for motor drives, including control of torque, speed, and position through various feedback methodologies.

## Key Concepts

### Feedback Controlled Drive
- Purpose: Control of motor output parameters like torque, speed, and position.
- Components: Electric machine (motor), mechanical load, Power Processing Unit (PPU), sensors, and controllers.
- Feedback Mechanism: Measured output is compared with the desired reference value; the error is used by the controller to adjust the input to the PPU.

### Cascade Control Structure
- Controllers designed for controlling torque, speed, and position in a hierarchical manner.
- The torque controller operates as the innermost loop, followed by the speed loop, with the position controller as the outermost.
- **Bandwidth Considerations:**
  - Torque Loop: Fastest bandwidth
  - Speed Loop: Slower than torque
  - Position Loop: Slowest to ensure stability and avoid oscillations.

### Control System Representation
- **Open Loop Gain:** Represents the system's behavior without feedback. Given by \( G(s) = G_c(s) G_p(s) \).
- **Closed Loop Gain:** Represents behavior with feedback. Given by \( G(s) = \frac{G_{OL}(s)}{1 + G_{OL}(s)} \).
- Critical parameters include accuracy, speed, and stability.

### Transfer Functions
- Transfer functions are derived in the Laplace domain for the plant (system being controlled) and the controller.
- Mathematical models provide insight into system dynamics.

### Bode Plot Analysis
- **Accuracy:** Flat response near 0 dB.
- **Speed:** Corresponds to bandwidth; higher bandwidth indicates faster response.
- **Stability:** Assessed through phase margin. Ideally, a phase margin of 45-60 degrees is required for stability.

### Plant Representation
- Breakdown of the PPU and motor components into manageable mathematical representations.
- Plant includes components like resistors, inductance, and operational characteristics such as back-emf related to the angular velocity.

## Controller Model Design
### Proportional Integral (PI) Controller
- The controller combines proportional gain (Kp) and integral action (Ki) to eliminate steady-state error.
- Structured feedback loop calculates an error signal to update the control signal.

## Example Controller Design
### Controllers for DC Motor
- Design for torque (shortest response time), speed (one order of magnitude slower), and position (slowest).
- Development includes simplifying assumptions to aid in modeling.
- Performance criteria relate to Bode plots for accuracy, speed, and stability.

### Torque (Current) Controller
1. **Modeling:** Uses back-emf, current, input voltage relationships.
2. **Simplifications:** Assumes no-load conditions for controller design.
3. **Open Loop Response:** Analyzed for accuracy and speed.

### Speed and Position Control
- **Speed Controller:** Typically has lower bandwidth and inherits dynamics from the torque loop.
- **Position Controller:** Bandwidth is often an order of magnitude lower than speed, limiting its responsiveness.

## Conclusion
The session emphasizes the importance of understanding the control loops' dynamics, transfer functions, and criteria for optimal performance of motor drive systems. Each control loop's design and analysis determine the overall effectiveness in achieving stated motor performance objectives.
