Definition of Induction
Where:
n: number windings
G: form factor (length and width)
¬µ: permeability of medium

Now, we start with the inductive displacement sensors. There is one mayor
difference: in resistive sensors we needed to have contact in order to have
an action, contact leads to friction and therefore erosion. In inductive sensors
we do not need a contact but we can use a magnetic field. If you remember
from the first lecture of the course, if in a conductor there is a current, a
magnetic field appears (Ampere‚Äôs Law). The idea of inductive sensors is then
to use this magnetic field (or fluctuations of it) to measure the displacement,
where, of course, the biggest advantage is that it is contactless.
This equation will steer the interactions.
In it, L is the self induction and it will depend on the number of windings, on
the geometric form factor, and the permeability of the medium.
What could we do to measure displacement? We could vary one of these
components:
‚Ä¢ Changing the number of windings might be difficult as it belongs to the
structure. This is not so obvious!
‚Ä¢ We could deform the material to change the form factor
‚Ä¢ Or, we could induce a certain core in and out, and by changing the core,
we can change the permeability of the medium of the inductor.
As we will see today, the biggest challenge is to understand how to measure
the displacement from the variation of magnetic field!

Now, we can go through a few examples where you will understand what we
mean.
Here we see one first example: Self induction sensors:
‚Ä¢ Two coils in series. By changing the distance between the two coils, the
self-inductance of the total coil will change. The closer together the higher
the self inductance. (Change of the form factor)
‚Ä¢ Another option is inducing the core of one coil. (change of permeability)
These are very simple systems (wire around a conductor)
But the self induction is not linear with the displacement which can become
very tricky.
Howeverit can be measuredand it is reproducible.
How do we measure this change in self inductance?
We can put it in an oscillator. What is an oscillator? This a system composed
by a capacitor and an inductor. Due to these, an oscillation frequency will be
generated meaning that it will oscillate. This frequency will be dependent on
the self inductance. If we take a fixed capacitor, the change on self
inductance will provoke a change in frequency. Of course, this relation is not
linearbut it can be calibrated and make very simple systems.
There is one interesting application to these devices: ingestiblesto measure
in body conditions. if we use this oscillating frequency as the transmitting
system of a transmitter. Imagine we could put this small device in an
ingestible to measure pressure inside our body and a receiver nearby. This
system will emit its frequency and if there is a displacement, it will change
and it will be detected by the receptor. And as it is contactlesswe can
actually crossthe barrier of the skin.

Another type of inductive sensors are the mutual induction sensors. How
would these work?
The primary coil gets a V excitation, due to it, there is a current that goes
through the coil and creates a magnetic field (Ampere). This magnetic field is
induced in the secondary coil, where we can measure an output voltage (like
in a transformer). Depending on the distance between the two coils the
induced voltage will change, where it will be larger as the coils get closer
together.
Moreover, this induced voltage in the secondary coil is
a function of the geometry of the coils (separation and
axial alignment), the number of primary and secondary
turns, and the frequency and amplitude of the
excitation voltage. Thus, it is not linear.
Alternatively, and more used nowadays, it is possible to
put a conductive core between the two coils. With the
movement of this core, the secondary coil will detect
more or less of the excitation magnetic field. This
second option can also be used for preventing SIDS.
The primary coil would be somewhere under the bed,
the secondary coil (as receiver) could be set on the
night stand and the core (piezo electric material) could
5
be placed on the baby. The breathing would be
detected as the regular change of magnetic field on
the receiving side. If the change does not occur, we
know that the baby is not breathing.

Here we can see the non linear behabiour. The primary
side is excited by a sinusoidal (AC) voltage. The
amplitude of the received voltage looks like shown on
the slide, where the plot shows the maximum
amplitude of V0. If the core is exactly in the middle, V0
is maximum, if the core is moved in different directions
(closer to the primary or to the secondary sides), the
amplitude of V0 decreases.
Thus, the induced voltage in the secondary coil is a
nonlinear function of the separation of the coils or the
position of the core.
To maximize the output signal, a frequency is selected
that causes the secondary coil (tuned circuit) to be in
resonance. The output voltage is detected with
standard demodulator and amplifier circuits. These
simple setups are often, though not always, used as
detectors rather than measurements because the
nonlinear behavior. Furthermore, they are contactless
so no wear, friction nor force, very long life time.
6
As these systems are non linear, there is a need for
linearizing them.

Differential transformer or LVDT sensors (1)
Linear Variable Differential Transformer
7
The differential transformer or Linear Variable Differential Transformer comes
exactly to do that, to linearize the relation between voltage and
displacement.
In a differential transformer, we have three coils, a primary and two
secondaries. A moving core is set in the middle. These two secondary coils
will pick up the magnetic field from the primary coil.
Here we can also see the construction, primary coil, two secondary coils and
the core which is in motion between the primary and the secondary coils.
Moreover, we can see the outputs of the different coils. If we have the
primary excitation sinusoidal like shown in the figure, we can see the
responses of the two secondary coils. In them, we can see that they are in
anti phase. One of them is in phase the other one will be in counterphase
(dephased180 degrees). Why is this the case?

Thus, we have the primary coil connected to the sinusoidal excitation
voltage, and the secondary coils which are in anti series. What does this
mean? This means that if we have the core in the middle, we will have
maximum voltage on both the secondary coils but of opposite sign.
What does it mean for the output? If the bar is in the middle from the two.
Their outputs are maximum but opposite, which means that Vout=0.
Now, imagine if we move the core upwards: If we move the core upwards,
the upper voltage will increase and the down one will decrease. If we sum up
these two, we will get voltage that is in phase with the excitation voltage.
If, on the other hand, we move the core down, the upper voltage decreases
and the down voltage increases. Therefore, the output voltage will be in anti
phase (opposite) with the excitation voltage.
In summary, if we move up, the increase is in phase, if down it is in
antiphase. This means that we need synchronous detection where when the
two signals are in phasewe have a positive signal and when they are in anti
phasewe have a negative signal. We will see this in the detection system
later.

Here we see the summary of what we were discussing. The red coil is in
phase, the red curve is the behaviourof the secondary coil in phase, the
green one shows the one of the secondary coil in antiphase. What we can
see here is that by putting the two coils in opposite direction and the core in
the middle, we actually getto have a linear behaviourwhich is something
very nice. The key will be to be able to detect this signal.

LVDT sensors: Synchronous detection (1)
‚Ä¢ The phase sensitive detector (PSD)
10
We will need a phase sensitive detector to detect the signal and be able to
understand it. In the figure we see the architecture of such a detector. The
input signal is just the reference signal. This system works in the following
manner, when the sinusoidal is greater than 0, the phase is positive and the
amplifier just amplifies the lobe, on the other hand, when it is negative, the
inverting amplifier takes charge as to invert the signal. This signal is then
rectified. Alternatively, if the core moves in the other direction, the line will be
rectified in the negative direction. We can see it in the video in the next slide.
10
LVDT sensors: Synchronous detection (2)
11
Here we have the excitation signal in the middle, and the inducted signal on
the two secondary coils left and right. When nothing happens, we have the
two signals equal and opposite, and we sum themand the output is 0 (as
expected).
Now, we can slowly start moving the core to the blue (positive) side (16 sec
in the video). In it, we see the effect of the core moved to that side, where
the output after detection (without rectification) is shown in red and the
output of the system is the one in purple.
We can move the core in the other direction (29 seconds in the video)and
we see the opposite behavior.
By the way, whatwe see on the clock is the displacement.
There is one problem (40 seconds in the video). Suppose that in time, the
excitation voltage decreases (for instance, due to temperature or other
issues in the input voltage). What will happen in this case? Both secondary
coils will actually alsodecrease in terms of voltageand this could lead to
errors. Meaning that the displacement detected (red) is different than the real
one (purple).
11
Differential transformer or LVDT sensors (5) ‚ÄìDetection circuit
12
How could we solve this dependence on the excitation voltage? We could
make calculation relative instead of absolute.
We actually cando this by using a simple circuit such as the one here
(AD598). This circuit has the three coils with the core. They are connected to
a circuit. Now, instead of just doing the standard A-B, what it does is to also
divide it by A+B. As such, we are making the relation relative and as we saw
with the resistive systems, by making the relation relative, we avoid problems
derived by temperature. This can be seen in the previous video (second 35)
where we see that the purple line is still detecting the correct position, as the
detection is performed with the relative calculation.

13
To sum up, these are the properties of the LVDT (pros and cons).
Moreover, on the side we can see a picture of a LVDT, the three coils are
inside the tube, you can also see the core which moves up and down
(related to pressure, for instance). We see a sealed connector. This means
that these types of systems can be used also under water.

This sensor is for rotational displacement where we need to know the
rotation of the shaft. This system might ring some bells of similarity with the
first part of the course, because what we actually havehere is a motor, with
a stator and a rotor. The stator is outsideand we have a rotating system or
rotor (exactly like in all the motors we have seen).
Now, how does it work?
In the electrical diagram we can see the coil of the rotor, and the two coils of
the stators. Why do we need two?
Let‚Äôs first focus on the perpendicular stator.
The rotor induces an AC magnetic field (through an excitation voltage). Now,
imagine we have the rotor excitation voltage and the stator perpendicular to
it. If the rotor is in position 0, there will not be any voltage induced into it.
However, as the rotor starts rotating, we will start having a magnetic field in
the stator until a maximum. If I have a 90 degrees turn in my rotor, it will
have a maximum voltage on the stator. Thus, the induced voltage will have
a dependency on the theta or position. Now, this means that we have a
voltage that changes sinusoidally with the position. But,we need a voltage
that would be constant, in order tobe able to measure it.
How do we solve this? We add a second coil parallel to the rotor (90 degrees
dephasedfrom the other one). As such, when one of them is maximum the
other one is 0 and viceversa. We will have the sine theta and the cosine
theta, meaning that we will have everything we need to know about the
position at any point in space.
There is still one problem. As an inductive sensor, we want to ensure that it
is contactless where I do not need any force to rotate it. However, to produce
the excitation voltage in the rotor, we will need to find a way in which this
excitation gets to the rotating rotor (without breaking it or brushing it). We will
14
use a rotating transformer! An excitation voltage is input to the rotating
transformer, and that is what the rotor uses as excitation voltage.
In summary, the working principles are:
‚Ä¢ an AC reference voltage, at frequencies up to a
few kHz, excites the rotor winding.
‚Ä¢ The magnitude of the voltage induced in any
stator winding is proportional to the sine of the
angle Œ∏, between the rotor coil axis and the
stator coil axis.
‚Ä¢ If we have the two perpendicular stators, we
obtain a constant value.

Rotating transformer
15
In here we can see the two parts, the rotating transformer and the resolver
sensor. We can also see in real applications,on the top we see a bit of an
older version with the different parts. The lower example is more modern,
where the left part (the stator) is fixed somewhere, and the rotor can be
placed inside it without touching in order toget an understanding of the
position.

On its advantages:
It is very robust, there is no friction or anything so very long life time
It is not very expensive as compared to the type of precision that it provides
small dimensions
However, as we have two signals that need to be understood in order toget
the absolute value, there will be a bit of signal processing required.

There are quite some good news here, as there is a circuit able to convert
the resolver signals to digital.
How does it work?
Begin by assuming that the current state of the up/down counter is a digital
number representing a trial angle, œï.
The converter seeks to adjust the digital angle, œï, continuously to become equal to,
and to track Œ∏, the analog angle being measured.
The two outputs of the resolver are applied to cosine
and sine multipliers. These multipliers incorporate sine
and cosine lookup tables and function as multiplying
digital-to-analog converters.
The resolver's stator output voltages are written as:
V1 = V sinœât sinŒ∏
V2 = V sinœât cosŒ∏
Œ∏ is the angle of the resolver's rotor.
The digital angle œï is applied to the cosine multiplier,
and its cosine is multiplied by V1 to produce the term:
V sinœât sinŒ∏ cosœï.
17
The digital angle œï is also applied to the sine
multiplier and multiplied by V2 to product the term:
V sinœât cosŒ∏ sinœï.
These two signals are subtracted from each other
by the error amplifier to yield an AC error signal of
the form:
V sinœât [sinŒ∏ cosœï ‚Äì cosŒ∏ sinœï].
Using a simple trigonometric identity, this reduces
to:
V sinœât [sin (Œ∏ ‚Äìœï)].
The detector synchronously demodulates this AC
error signal, using the resolver's rotor voltage as a
reference.
This results in a DC error signal proportional to sin
(Œ∏‚Äìœï).
The DC error signal feeds an integrator, the output
of which drives a voltage-controlled-oscillator
(VCO). The VCO, in turn, causes the up/down
counter to count in the proper direction to cause:
sin (Œ∏ ‚Äì œï) ‚Üí 0
When this is achieved,
(Œ∏ ‚Äì œï) =0
and therefore
Œ∏ = œï
within one count. Hence, the counter's digital
output, œï, represents the angle Œ∏.
The latches enable this data to be transferred
externally without interrupting the loop's tracking.
17
As an extra output is the value of the velocity of the
resolver turning.
17
Resolver sensor (4)
18
This is the same schematic with some graphs on top. When we start the
system there is no error because phi and theta are 0. Now we increase the
angle theta (but we have not turned on the feedback signal so that phi
follows it). Now if we increase the value of theta, we start seeing the error in
the signal. This can be seen in the detector block (similar tothe LVDT)
We can then manually change the value of phi to a very close value to theta
and we see that the value of the error signals decrease.
Then, we can power up the feedback loop so that phi follows theta and as
you can see, the measurement of phi follows very nicely the change in theta.
Moreover, we get access to the velocity of the turning.
18
Inductosyns sensors (1)
19
The inductosynsprovide a very similar application as the resolver but in the
longitudinal direction. It can measure very accurately the movement.
In a pcb, we can make a trace in the longitudinal style (gray in the figures).
On top of that we will have a glider (also on a pcb) which floats about 1mm
on top of the pcbwith the same pattern but shorter. This is what we can see
in red on top of it. It will have the same pitch (same period). Now we connect
on the basic an excitation voltage (V1) which will produce a magnetic field.
Due to this magnetic field, a magnetic field will be induced on the glider (the
red one). We then can glide the glider on top of the windingand this induced
magnetic field will be picked up by it.
Thus, we can move the red pcbover the gray one and we can try to detect
the displacement between the two. In the top case, there is a maximum
voltage in use because we completely match the system (the period is about
2mm). Now we move our glider about ¬º of the pitch (equivalent to 90
degrees). In that case, nothing will be induced. If I go now half a pitch, we
have maximum but opposite polarity.

20
Here we can see what was just said but graphically.
We have the bottom trace and the slider on top.
For an excitation of Vsinwt, on the slider we will have induced magnetic field.
Again, as it was happening in the resolver, we will need to measure two
points to obtain the sine and the cosine of the displacement x.
20
Inductosyns (3)
21
How can we measure this displacement? Actuallywe can do it in the same
way as we were doing for the resolver. Now, instead of theta, we have
2piX/2. Thus, it now shows a displacement instead of an angle.
We can talk about the precision. If we have a pitch of 2mm and we can
measure within the pitch with a precision of the up/downcounter. In most
cases we will have a precision of 12 bits (which is actually nota lot for these
systems). This means that it can count from 0 to 4000. This means that
within a pitch we have a resolution of 2mm/4000. Thus, we can know the
position with a resolution of 500 nm. This has an enormous potential. Laser
printers use it. The main issue is that this is a relative position within a pitch.
Thus, at the start, we will need to bring the slider back to the beginning of the
support, it will count the pitches until reaching the required one and once in
the pitch it will detect with very high precision.
21
Rotary Inductosyns
22
There are also rotary inductosyns. We have two discs. The black one is the
excitation disc and the white one is the stator or inductive.
