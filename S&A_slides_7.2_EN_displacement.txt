What are motion sensors?
‚ÄúElectromechanical transducers that
convert motion quantities into
electrical quantities‚Äù

We will start the analysis of sensors with the displacement sensors, which
are one of the most common types and most simple sensor. These sensors
convert motion quantities into electrical quantities. Can anyone of you think
about a very simple type of motion sensor? A potentiometer converts motion
(turning of a wheel) into value of resistance and therefore output voltage.

Why do we start with motion or displacement sensors?
Well, actually thereason is that they are the most simplistic form of
measurement where a lot of other sensors (which we will discuss in the
remainder of the course) are actually composedinside by motion sensors.
In the figure you can see some examples of those.
Such are the cases of a pressure sensor, a bellows. If we put some pressure
in the input, it will provoke a displacement, this displacement can be
translated into voltage/resistance.
In the bimetallic element, an increase of temperature will provoke the bar to
bend. Temperature is transduced into movement. Same for the torsion bar
and the accelerometer, where the torque is transformed into angular motion
(remember actuators) or into linear movement (the mass-spring system
already described in systems and control theory).

‚Ä¢ A resistive potentiometer is a device in which a displacement is changed
into resistance.
‚Ä¢ This displacement can be either translational such as in the first figure or
rotational, such as in the second one. In fact, the second type of
potentiometer should look familiar to you. In it, the turning mechanism is
translated into a resistance value. We can also have rotational
potentiometers with multiturn structures. In them, we need to go further
than 360 degrees and the potentiometer allows for more rotations.
‚Ä¢ Ranges for the translational system is from 2mm to 50cm while for the
rotational is 10 degrees to 50 rotations. Thus, it is very easy to implement.
The resistance range is very broad, from 10 ohm to 1M Ohm.
‚Ä¢ Of course, we cannot use the value of the resistance in our data
acquisition, but we will need to have an input excitation voltage so that the
resistance can be translated into a voltage fell on the resistor. As such, it
works as a voltage divider. This can be easily seen from the translational
system. Thus, we need an excitation voltage. In most of the cases, a DC
voltage will be used, where we input DC voltage to obtain the divided DC
voltage. Sometimes, however, we can use AC. Why is this? Well, when
we have very small signals, we will need to amplify themand it is actually
easierto amplify an AC signal than a DC one. DC signals have a lot of
interference (like it could happen with the offset of an amplifier).
‚Ä¢ How is the transfer function of this potentiometer? Actually, itis a linear
and proportional model, where the voltage grows proportional to the
motion or displacement.
‚Ä¢ This is the inside of such a potentiometer. The wiper turns around and the
resistance takes certain value.
‚Ä¢ What type of material do we need to have this change on the resistance.
‚Ä¢ The most simpleand most used material is actually carbon
7
material. Carbon has the property of having a certain
resistance. It is not a very good conductor or a very good
insulator. It is something between the two. It is important to
know that carbon is not a semi conductor. A very good
property of carbon is that it is self lubricating which helps with
a very low friction coefficient. As we have a mechanical
component, there is some friction causing some erosion. So,
the lower the friction coefficient, the lower the erosion, the
longer the life time. Unfortunately, carbon does not have a
friction coefficient of 0, so it will wear out with time. It is also
very cheap. When do we use carbon? When we need
something that is not used very often (the wheel of a radio)
‚Ä¢ Another material that can be used is a wire wound. It is a wire
which has a certain resistance. It is not a copper wire,
because copper has a very low resistance. It is mostly used
for power potentiometers. One very interesting property of
these potentiometers is the resolution. As the wiper moves
back and forth over the different resistance wires, the voltage
will be changing in steps. This is a difference as compared
with the carbon potentiometer, which are analogue, meaning
the resolution is 0.
‚Ä¢ The best material in an application as a sensor which needs to
last long are the conducting plastics. It is a composite material
with extremely low friction coefficient. One of the lowest
friction coefficient is Tefflon. It is used in potentiometers. First,
the friction coefficient is so low that you do not need force to
turn it. If the friction is so low, the erosion is nearly non-
existentand the life-time is very veryhigh. However, it is
expensive.
‚Ä¢ To sum up, the problems of potentiometers come in the form of
friction and resolution.

Resistive potentiometer characteristics in sensors
‚Ä¢ Linear ideal (voltage vs displacement)
‚Ä¢ Friction (depending on the material)
‚Ä¢ Hysteresis
‚Ä¢ Noise voltage
‚Ä¢ Relative large displacement (from mm to meters)
‚Ä¢ Maximal excitation voltage:
ùëí = ùëÉ ùëÖ
(cid:3032)(cid:3051) (cid:3040)(cid:3028)(cid:3051) (cid:3043)(cid:3042)(cid:3047)
8
For the case of sensors, we will focus on:
‚Ä¢ Almost always linear potentiometers, there are some logarithmic
potentiometers (such as for sound)but we will not use those.
‚Ä¢ We will have friction depending on the used material.
‚Ä¢ We will also have some hysteresis, as we saw in the previous session.
The wiper (mechanical system) can have some hysteresis because it can
give you another value if you turn it in different directions.
‚Ä¢ Another disadvantage is noise. As it is a mechanical movement, it can
produce some noise in the voltage while turning it. Of course, resistors
always produce noise, the higher the temperature, the higher the noise.
However, when the wiper moves, it can provoke some extra noise
‚Ä¢ A big advantage is its relativelarge displacement. We can have
displacement from millimeters to very large distances.
‚Ä¢ Finally, we will need to take care of the maximum excitation voltage. When
we input an excitation voltage to the potentiometer, it will heat up (due to
Jules law). The heat has two disadvantages: (1) because it heats up, it will
change the resistance; (2)If so, the output could change. However, if the
change is an absolute change of the resistance, it could be that it does not
change the relative portion of the resistance we are taking. Moreover, we
cannot exceed the maximal excitation voltage because it is the maximum
power that the potentiometer can dissipate. Why would we want very high
excitation voltage? Well, the higher the excitation voltage the bigger the
signal to noise ratio which will help on the data acquisition. Howeverwe
will not be able to exceed the maximum excitation voltage, because it is
the maximum that the potentiometer can handle.

Resistive potentiometers: Structure of a multiple turn
potentiometer
9
This is the design of a multiple turn potentiometer. We can see the rod, the
plastic wiper block and the conductive plastic film. When the rod, rotates, the
wiper block moves along the plastic and the resistance changes.

We will need to connect the potentiometer to the data acquisition system,
such as what we have in this figure. Ideally, the Rp is proportional to the
displacement xi, as we have shown before.
However, the data acquisition equipment will have a certain internal
resistance Rm. This means that the more realistic equivalent circuit has two
resistors in parallel and it is not linear anymore.
Thusthe proportionality does not hold anymore, and the relation between
input and output voltage looks like this (you can try to solve it at home).
Now, if Rm is infinite, and therefore Rp/Rm equals 0, we will have the ideal
formula of proportionality. However, this is not going to be the case, as Rm it
will never be infinite. As we can see in the figure, as the relation increases,
the potentiometer curve becomes less and less linear.
How can we try to solve this? First, we can first try to make it as big as
possible. Second, we can try to compensate it.
10
Resistive potentiometers: Connection to the data acquisition (2)
‚Ä¢ We can compensate the effect with electronics
‚Ä¢ We can compensate it with the computer, if we know the relations and all the
values, we can just calculate it and ‚Äúlinearize‚Äù it a posteriori.
11
How do we compensate the effect? We can add a linearizing resistor and
making sure that this resistor is of the same value as the input impedance of
the data acquisition system. As such we can get this graph. In it we can see
that without the Rin, the curve is very much non linear, but adding the Rin,
we can somehow counter the effect.
Another option is to linearize it by means of calculations. If we know all the
relationships and values, we can just calculate the voltage change provoked
by the displacement.

We can also have very long potentiometers such as the one on the left. On
the right we see a very special type of potentiometer, it is actually a2-
directional potentiometer (composed by 2 potentiometer). It is the stick of a
joystick

Resistive Strain Gages
When a thin wire (ex:25¬µm) is stretched (displacement) the
electrical resistance is changed due to 3 effects:
‚Ä¢ The length increases
‚Ä¢ The diameter is decreased
‚Ä¢ Piezo-resistive effect
16
What is a strain gage? When a thin wire is stretched, the resistance changes
due to
‚Ä¢ the increase in the length (the longer the material, the higher the
resistance),
‚Ä¢ the decrease in diameter (a thinner wire means higher resistance),
‚Ä¢ The specific resistance of my material can also change because the
structure inside the wire can change. This is called the piezo-resistive
effect.
Thus, we have again a resistive sensor, where displacement is changed into
a resistive effect.
16
Resistive Strain Gages: Behavior
17
Of course, if we stretch the wireit will have some limitations.
In the figure we see strain vs stress. We see a linear area called the elastic
zone, that leads to saturation (or yield point).
We should stay in the elastic zone, where we will have a proportional linear.
If we go over that point, we enter in the plastic region, werethe strain will not
go back to the initial length.
The maximum strain of a steel wire, for instance, is about 0.2%. If we have a
wire of 1m long, we can stretch maximum 2 millimeter.

18
Now, how does the resistance change when we stretch the gage.
First, we have the value of the resistance of the material, which should be:
the length, multiplied by the resistivity of the material (rho), divided by the
area. So, we have a dependance on the length, the resistivity and the area.
Now, what happens if the strain gage gets stretched? What changes?
Actually, everythingis dependent on this elongation according to the rules we
just stablished. Thus, length, area, and resistivity will change. How? It is
difficult to say, we can slowly go through the equations.
To understand what happens to the area, we can define the poisson‚Äôsratio,
which is a measure of the poissoneffect (the deformation of a material in
directions perpendicular to the specific direction of loading). Applying this, v
(or the ratio) is equal to the increment of diameter, divided by the increment
of length. Where we can name dL/L as epsilon or strain
Moreover, we can calculate the derivative of the resistance, taking in to
account de changes on the three variables, which will also be dependent
among one another. As such, we get this derivative of the resistor.

Now, the area changes, the length changes. Does the Volume change? We
can try to understand this.
Volume is area times length. And the differential of volume is then AdL+ LdA
Additionally, we can define the differential of volume as the difference
between the new volume and the old volume. We can rearrange the
equation a bit and substitute by the poissonratio.
Now, I said in thrprevious slide, the strain or epsilon is a very small number
(0.2% for steel), this means that we can assume that epsilon times the
poissonratio squared will be very verysmall (smaller than 1). Thus, we can
just discard it in the calculation and get the next equation.
For the same reason, the term on epsilon square is very small and can be
ignored. Then the two AL cancel eachothersout. This means that the volume
change is dependanton the area, length, the strain and the poissonratio.
Now we can try to look at this and analysewhat we are seeing. Imagine we
use a fluid as a strain gage. If we change the length, would the volume
change ? No, right? Because the area will just increase, because of the
fluidity and the volume stay the same. This means that if the dV= 0 (no
change) -> the poissonratio has tobe 0.5
What about if v> 0.5 -> is that possible? If that‚Äôs the case the differential
would be negative and the volume would decrease, which is also not
possible.
Thusv needs to be smaller than 0.5. Can it be negative? No! because it
would measnthat if we pull a wire the diameter will increase.
19
In summary, the poissonconstant needs to be between 0 and 0.5 and if
it is a fluid, it needs to be 0.5.

Gage Factor
(sensitivity of the strain gage)
20
Now we can continue with the rest of the calculations. Where we combine
equations 2 and 3 and substitute LdAfrom (1).
We get to the Gage factor or sensitivity of the strain gage) which is the
relative variation of resistance to the relative length variation (the strain).
It is composed of three parts. First there is a 1 because there is a
proportional relation between the change in length and the change in
resistance. The next one is 2 times the nu or poissonconstant, which is due
to the decreasing area. Finally, the relative change in resistivity due to the
change in length. This is something more difficult to calculate. Some
materials will have a strong piezo resistive effect overpowering the other
factors.

Resistive strain gages: Tips to take home
‚Ä¢ GF and known: The displacement can be
calculated
‚Ä¢ The relative deviation of the resistance is proportional to the
(cid:3031)(cid:3019) (cid:3031)(cid:3013)
relative deviation of displacement, times the GF (
(cid:3019) (cid:3013)

(cid:3019) (cid:3013) (cid:3013) (cid:3019)
21
If we know the GF and the relative change of resistance, we can calculate
the strain (relative change in length)
Moreover, the relative deviation of resistance will be proportional to the
relative deviation of displacement.
Now imagine steel, which has a GF of around 2., and we know from before
that steel has a maximum strain of 0.2% which I said before, then the
maximum change in resistance is about 0.4% which is very verysmall.

22
Now we can discuss the Gage factors of some materials. Constantan, which
is a material composed by niqueland cupper has a GF of 2.1, why shall we
use this material? Because the temperature coefficient is very verysmall. If
the temperature would change, also the resistor change. It could happen that
if the resistor change to apply is very small, the temperature has a bigger
temperature change than the one provoked by the strain and we need to
avoid this. Thus, we need to keep the temperature coefficient as low as
possible.
If we need materials that have a longer elongation range, we have other
materials such as the isoelastic. The GF is higher and the temperature coeff.
Is still ok.
One interesting case is the Nickel, which has a negative GF. How is this
possible? Remember that the GF is 1 + 2v + change in resistivity. 1 and 2v
are positive numbers, right? So, the factor comes from the change in
resistivity. This means that Nickel has a very strong negative piezo-electric
effect. Moreover, the temperature coefficient is very high.
We can also see the case of the semiconductor Sillicon, which has a very
high GF. This gives us the opposite behaviour. A very strong piezo-resistive
effect.
These are then piezo-resistive materials, because the strain is mainly
dependent on the piezo-resistivity. And we could create sensors with a
strong piezo-resistive effect or anti-piezo-resistive.
Unfortunaly, they also have very high temperature coefficient. This could
however, be countered within the sensor, as we could have a measurement
22
of temperature and compensate it.
22
Resistive Strain gages: Temperature coefficient & GF
‚Ä¢ GF is temperature dependent
‚Ä¢ Typical temperature coefficient: 0.01%/K (100ppm/K)
‚Ä¢ Its distorting effect is relatively small and can be ignored
‚Ä¢ Except for high accurate measurement systems
23
We were discussing about the temperature dependance of the resistor itself.
But, what about the GF, how is that one affected by the temperature
change? We would want it to be very stable. The gage factor is in fact
dependent on temperature. However, the effect is very small and can be
ignored except for very high precissionand very accurate measurements.

Any questions?
