How to measure force?
• It can be balanced again gravitation force
• Acceleration can be measured of a known mass
• It can produce an hydraulic pressure which is measured
• It can develop a displacement on an elastic material
3
Now, how can we measure force? Force can be measured in a number of
ways:
• First, thanks to the gravity force, we can balance the force we want to
measure against the gravitation. If we know the mass and the gravity
acceleration, we can calculate the gravitational force.
• Second, we can measure force through the acceleration. If we know the
mass, according to Newton’s first law (F=ma), and we can measure the
acceleration, we can calculate the force needed to displace this mass.
• Third, some transducer can transduce force intro pressure, which we can
then measure. This is the example of both sensors shown, where the
hydraulic load cell and the pneumatic load cell convert pressure into force.
• BUT, the most used method to measure force is the force that can develop
a displacement on an elastic material. What is an elastic material? (a
spring for instance). Here you can find a very typical example, we have a
spring (spring constant k) and we have a linear variable differential
transformer to measure the displacement. This session we will dedicate it
mostly to this elastic force transducer

How does an elastic force transducer look like? It looks a bit like the
accelerometer if you remember from last session.
Now we do not move the sensor anymore but we just put a force on the
mass, the spring shrinks and we get a displacement. We might also need a
damping to control how much the spring shrinks as of course this is a second
order system.

Elastic Force transducer: Load cell
Force transducers with strain gages
Force sensors under tension or
compression
5
This is the most used force sensor, the load cell.
We have a steel bar, and the force is transduced to the compression of that
steel bar.
This compression is sensed by four strain gages (all around).
If you look closely, the strain gage 1 is positioned vertically while the strain
gage 2 is horizontal. Why do we need that? If we put the four strain gages in
the same direction and we compress.
We can put the four gages on a Wheatstone bridge. What will happen? The
effect on the four gages will be the same and we will not have an output. If
you remember, in order to have a good sensor, we needed two resistors to
increase and two to decrease. This is not possible here if we have all gages
in the same direction.
Thus, two of them are horizontal, and two are vertical. Why is this the
solution? If we put a force in the vertical direction, the vertical gages will be
compressed. What happens to the horizontal ones? According to poisson,
with steel having a poisson’sconstant of 0.3, the horizontal will expand itself
(1 mm shrink will provoke a 0.3mm expansion on the horizontal).
Thus, in this way we have two elements that increase and two elements that
decrease.
However they do not increase and decrease in the same way, right?
They have a different sensitivity two by two. Thus, we need to calculate the
sensitivity of this sensor.
5
Elastic Force transducer: Load cell – Sensitivity (1)
Let’s calculate an example based on Strain gage load cell
The load-sensing member:
Width and depth 1cm
Steel: E = 200 GPa
𝑣=0.3
4 active arm strain gage bridge with oriented elements as in:
GF=2
𝑉 =10V
(cid:3032)(cid:3051)
6
We can calculate the sensitivities through this example.
We have a load sensing member with this width and depth and this poisson
value.
Be careful, that we will have two poissonconstants, one of the steel bar,
which we will need to understand the elongation of the gage, and we will
have the poissonconstant of the strain gage. But, this one is already
included in the GF of the strain gage.
We also have the GF of the strain gages and an excitation voltage on the
wheastonebridge of 10 V.

Elastic Force transducer: Load cell – Sensitivity (2)
The load-sensing member:
Width and depth 1cm
Steel: E = 200 GPa
Calculation of the sensitivity of the bridge:
𝑉 𝑅 𝑅 𝑣=0.3
(cid:2868) (cid:2871) (cid:2872)
= − 4 active arm strain gage bridge
𝑉 𝑅 +𝑅 𝑅 +𝑅
Under stress: (cid:3032)(cid:3051) (cid:2871) (cid:2870) (cid:2869) (cid:2872) with oriented elements as in:
GF=2
𝑅 =𝑅 =𝑅 →𝑅+Δ𝑅 𝑅 =𝑅 =𝑅 →𝑅−𝑣Δ𝑅
(cid:2869) (cid:2871) (cid:2870) (cid:2870) 𝑉 =10V
(cid:3032)(cid:3051)
𝑉 𝑅+Δ𝑅 𝑅 −𝑣Δ𝑅
(cid:2868)
= −
𝑉 𝑅+Δ𝑅+𝑅−𝑣Δ𝑅 𝑅+Δ𝑅+𝑅−𝑣Δ𝑅
(cid:3032)(cid:3051)
𝑅 𝑅
𝑉 Δ𝑅(1+𝑣) (cid:2869) (cid:2870)
(cid:2868)
=
𝑉 (cid:3032)(cid:3051) 2𝑅+Δ𝑅(1−𝑣) 𝑉 (cid:3032)(cid:3051) 𝑉 (cid:3003) - 𝑉 (cid:2868) + 𝑉 (cid:3002)
Now: 2𝑅 ≫ Δ𝑅(1−𝑣)
𝑅 (cid:2872) 𝑅 (cid:2871)
So:
𝑉 Δ𝑅(1+𝑣) Δ𝑅(1+𝑣)
(cid:2868)
= =
𝑉 2𝑅 𝑅 2
(cid:3032)(cid:3051)
7
The sensitivity will be the output voltage divided by the force in this case.
First, we can calculate V0/Vex as we calculated it in the displacement
wheatstonebridge. Va-Vb, which comes to down to the first equation.
Now we have a force and a compression, as such R1 and R3 become 𝑅+
Δ𝑅. What happens with R2 and R4. Actually they will reduce but not in the
same manner, but multiplied by the poissonconstantof steel, as they are
horizontal.
If we put all of these in the formula, we have this new relation.
Now, of course, Δ𝑅 will be much smaller than 2R. Thus, it can just be
eliminated.
If you remember from the strain gages, we had delta R over 2R. Now, by
changing the direction of two out of the four strain gages we add a factor
which will increase the sensitivity by the factor nu.

This setup has a rather low sensitivity but a high maximum load!
8
This is then, the change in voltage related to the change in resistance and
we need to find a way to relate it to the force.
From the gage factor we know that the change in resistance is equal to the
GF times the strain. The strain is the force divided by the area times Young’s
modulus. Thus, the sensitivity of the load cell will be as shown.
Now we can have a look at the formula.
How can we increase the sensitivity?
• We can increase the GF (by changing the material of the strain gage)
• We can increase the excitation voltage, but this is not that easy, as it will
increase the temperature and the dissipation power.
• We cannot change the poissonfactor.
• We can reduce the area of the load cell
• We could use other materials with smaller young’s modulus, more elastic.
Now, what is the influence of the temperature now?
• We do not have a dependance on the resistance.
• The GF will be temperature sensitive but only a bit.
• The excitation voltage should be temperature stable but this is a problem.
How to solve this? We will just measure it. Nowadays, there are data
acquisition systems that can measure the excitation voltage in an
analogue output as well as the output voltage. If we know both, we can
eliminate the influence of the temperature. It is a rational measurement.
• The area will not change with temperature.
• The Young’s modulus will change by temperature. The elasticity will
change with temperature, but it is ok.
With these values, the sensitivity is 650nV/N. This could be a question of the
8
exam.
That rather low sensitive, will give a very small output. Thus, we will
need very strong force to have a noticeable output.

Elastic Force transducer: Load cell – Sensitivity (4)
• At load of 100 kg or 10000N (10KN) ->Output is 6.5 mV:
• Acceptable
• Above the noise
• Still it has to be amplified
• The maximum load?

(cid:3040)(cid:3028)(cid:3051) (cid:3040)(cid:3028)(cid:3051)
Low sensitive sensor but with a very high range
9
What would happen if we have a load of 100 Kg or 10KN? then the output
would be 6.5 mV. Bellow that it will drown into the noise.
How can we calculate the maximum load? We know the maximum strain of
steel to be 0.2%, right?
The maximum force would be 40KN, which is equivalent to 4000Kg (4 tons)
These are load cells for trucks.
This is a low sensitive sensor but with a very big range

10
The old fashion way to cope with the change in the young’s modulus due to
the temperature, we can add two resistors at the excitation voltage, which
will be temperature dependent and will just change the excitation voltage.
Nowadays, it is possible to just measure the temperature. As if we know the
temperature and the dependance in the Young modulus, we can calculate
and compensate the correction.
10
Elastic Force transducer: Load cell – Temperature effect (1)
• Using Wheatstone bridges will compensate for the change in resistance:
o Even with only 1 strain gage, we can use a dummy gage (strain gage in place of fixed
resistor) in the same arm to compensate
• GF is temperature dependent
o temperature coefficients of 0.01 %/K, its distorting effect on the measurement result is usually
relatively small.
o A computational compensation (for temp measurement) is also feasible.
• Modulus of elasticity is temperature dependent
o Typical value for steel is approx. -0.02%/K
o In experimental stress analysis effect is ignored (Calibration and compensation)
• Excitation voltage causes the strain gage to heat up in comparison with the meas. body
o Depending on thermal conductivity (mes. body), heat conductance is more/less absorbed
o If poor conduction, result may be a difference in temperature
11
The main issue of these load cells is then
temperature.
• First, if we have the four resistors in the
wheatstone, we will not have an impact.
However, what if we have only one strain
gage? then the SG will not be compensated.
The SG will experience a change of
temperature. In that case, we will use a
dummy gage in the same arm. A dummy gage
is a strain gage used in place of a fixed resistor.
Temperature compensation is achieved when
this dummy gage is mounted on a piece of
material similar to the specimen which
undergoes the same temperature changes as
does the specimen, but which is not exposed
to the same or opposite strain. Quarter
bridges can have temperature compensation if
11
a dummy gage is used.
• Second, GF is temperature dependent, but
not much, as you remember from the
displacement sensors. If we are within the
1% accuracy, this is not much. If we need a
higher accuracy, and it will affect, we can
just measure and do a compensation.
• Third, the modulus of elasticity (Young) is
temperature dependent. Within a certain
range, it can be ignored, if higher needed
then it can be also compensated.
• Fourth, the excitation voltage is dependent. The solution is to
measure it.
11
Elastic Force transducer – Load cell -Temperature effect (2)
• Adhesive creep
As temp increases, adhesives become soft -> no transfer 100% of the strain
o
Comparable with declining gage factor-> observe temp limits
o
• In conclusion: If we know the temperature, we can always correct
12
Something we cannot cope with or compensate is the creep. But glueingthe
strain gage to the bar, we add a maximum temperature range. At a certain
temperature, it can be more elastic. The total strain on the bar will not be the
same as the strain gage. Thus, we will need to observe the temperature
limits.
In conclusion, if we know the temperature, and the strain measured, we can
just calculate the correction factor.

13
Suppose that instead of compressing, we would bend the strain gage to get
the force. we fix the substractin one end and put a force on the other. And
the strain gages on top and below the surface. SG 1 and 3 will become
longer (positive strength) while 2 and 4 will become shorter. This is great,
because the elongation will be equal to the compression.
You can also see here illustrations of what happens in such an elastic
transducer. Moreover, these sensors are pretty small as you can see there.

Elastic Force transducer: Under bending – Strain
• The load 𝐹 produces a moment 𝑀 = 𝐹𝐿 at a gage location (𝐿)that results in the following strains:

ε = −ε = ε = −ε =

o σ (cid:3029): stress (𝑁⁄𝑚(cid:2870)) or 𝑃𝑎 𝑀 (cid:3029)

o 𝑀 (cid:3029): moment (𝑁𝑚)
o 𝑍: section modulus (𝑚(cid:2871))
o F: force (N)
o L: distance between the strain gage and the force on the beam (m)
14
Now we can try to calculate first the strain to then calculate the sensitivity.
The strains will be the same for all the strain gages with different signs. We
will need to calculate the bending stress sigma b.
Sigma is the bending moment divided by Z.
The bending moment will be defined as the Force times L, where L is the
distance to the beginning of the plank and the point where the momentum is
calculated (not the length of the full bar).
Z will depend on the structure of the sensors.
14
Elastic Force Transducer: Under bending – Section modulus
15
Here we can see the section modulus for different structures. For a full bar
for instance is like shown in the first row. You will not need to know these
section modulus by heart for the exam. If you need it, it will be given to you.

16
Now we can calculate the output voltage.
We can put the Z in the strain.
We know we have a full bridge with four SG, the output voltage relates to the
excitation voltage times the relative change of R.
And we know that AR/R is equal to GF times the strain.
What would be the sensitivity? Vo/F
Again we can see what are the dependance of the sensitivity of the different
factor.
• The GF
• The excitation voltage
• The length (the longer we make it the best)
• The width and height. If they decrease we will have a more sensitive
because it will be more elastic.

In this case, the sensitivity is: 1.5mV/N This results in a high sensitivity but with a small maximum force
18
We have two strain gages on the top and bottom. If I only use two we have a
V0/Vex as deltaR/2R. You can see that in the book or when we discussed
the strain gages.
We then can obtain the sensitivity.
We have an output of 1.5mV/N. This is a very sensitive sensor

This is also a load cell, very useful in industry. We have forces on the top
and the bottom and the strain gages on the top. This is again a bending
elastic force transducer. When the forces apply, they will bend to the middle
in a way that SG 1 and 3 get elongated and 2 and 4 get shrunk. This system
is used in weighing scales. It has also a mechanical safety mechanism, the
air gap, which will close whenever the force is just getting too far.

It is also possible to do the bending elastic force transducer with piezo-
resistive materials. If you remember piezo-resistive materials
(semiconductors) had very high GF, where there was a slight dependance
with temperature. Using four p materials (positive) for the four SG we can
create a system that has a very high GF, and therefore high sensitivity.

22
In the center we have an LVDT (the 3 coils and the inner core). What is the
elastic element is a spring, which are screwed at both sides of the LVDT. If
they get stressed, the core will be able to measure the displacement. What is
one of the best things about this system? With one LVDT, we can change the
sensitivity of the system just by changing the springs. Moreover, we could
have a preset screwing the two springs.

This system is used on aerodynamic measurements. It is the piezoelectric
impedance head. For instance, to understand the aerodynamic
characteristics of the car, it would measure the force we need to keep the car
in place. The lower the force, the more aerodynamic. Thus, it will be the
Force divided by the velocity.
How do we measure? Instead of having two separated sensors, one for
velocity. We will have two piezoelectric materials. For the upper part you
might recognize the accelerometer of previous class. It measures
acceleration. Bellow, we have the one that will measure force. How do we
get the velocity? We need to integrate the acceleration.

Force sensitive resistor FSR (1)
25
This one is described as a force sensor, but it could also be considered a
pressure sensor. When we push the resistance is reduce. Thus, we are
putting some pressure.
It is composed by an elastomer with conductor elements inside. When we
press, the resistance changes on it.
The relation between force and resistance can be seen as well.
It is not linear at all, it only gives an idea of the force.
These sensors are not used very often, because they have a very large time
constant. It is not for changing forces (not for dynamic)
25
Force sensitive resistor FSR (2)
• High resistance dynamic range
• Low cost
• Low accuracy (10%)
26
Here you can see how it looks on reality. It is very low cost, but not very
accurate.
It could be used to do something creative, like putting it under a tile on the
floor that could trigger a light.
