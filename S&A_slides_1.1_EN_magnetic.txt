This is a model of a motor. As a model, it helps us understand how a motor behaves.
The model consists of three parts: a resistor (Ra), an inductor (La) and a voltage source
(ea or back-emf).
• The resistor tells us there is some ohmic component to it. This also means that if a
current goes through it, we get a voltage loss across. We will see by the end of the
lecture where this loss comes from, but for now it is already enough to say that it
models the long wires in the motors.
• The second component is an inductor (La). Through the wires in the motor there are
currents which create a magnetic field (Ampere’s Law). This leads to inductive
behavior. The inductive behavior tells us that the current cannot change
instantaneously and it needs a voltage.
• Finally, the third component is the voltage source, which is a representation of the
voltage generated by the motor. Every motor will generate a voltage.
So, let’s understand how it works: We apply a voltage to the two -ends of the motor. It
creates a current, which is proportional to the torque. Torque is Force x radius, you will
remember from other courses.
Once it starts moving, a voltage appears, which is called the back-emf. It is proportional
to the angular velocity. It is important to understand that Emf stands for electromotive
force but it is not a force but a voltage expressed in Volts. One interesting thing about
the back-emf is that it allows for the motor to work as a generator. If the applied voltage
stops, there will still be a running current thanks to the back-emf.
Voltage will be dropped both in the resistor and the inductor.
Now, the purpose of the design is that the voltage dropped on them is as small as
3
possible and the back-emf is the closer to the applied voltage as possible.
In such case, the conversion between electrical and mechanical power is ideal.
Electrical power is Voltage times current and the Mechanical power is torque times
angular velocity.
In the ideal world, where the resistor can be neglected, both powers are equal.
Now, let’s try to understand how the motor works starting from the basics of induction
and magnetic fields.

Ampere’s Law: definition
“When a current I is passed through a conductor, a magnetic field B or H is
created.”
(I Magnetic field)
B or H perpendicular Right hand rule –Important to

So, let’s go back to Physics! This is Ampere’s law.
What does Ampere’s law say? It states that if a current is passed through a conductor, a
magnetic field is generated. Showing this in the left figure, a current is passed through
the cable and the magnetic field (denoted by B or H) is created, perpendicular to the
current.
Moreover, to understand the direction of the magnetic field, we can use the right-hand
rule (as shown on the screen), where the thumb represents the current and the rest of
the fingers, the magnetic field.
It is important to understand that Ampere’s Law says that Electric currents generate
Magnetic fields – IN THAT DIRECTION, not the other way around.

Now we apply it to a specific case – The ring

Ampere’s Law → 𝐻 = = [A/m]

Here we have a ring of a certain material, chosen with a high permeability. Around it, we
have a conductor that goes around it several times and there is a current running
through it.
What is the intensity of the magnetic field, H, and in which direction will it flow?
If we grab the ring and we set the direction of the current, we see the magnetic field will
be flowing clockwise.
In the ideal situation the magnetic field will be the same anywhere (constant) and in the
direction of the ring. Thus the integral becomes a scalar multiplication. In the figure b,
we can see the cross-section representation. As we are interested on the current
enclosed within the ring, it will be N times the current conductor.
According to Ampere’s law, the H is the number of windings of the conductor times the
current divided by the path, which as it is a ring is 2 pi the radius.
Conclusions:
- The magnetic field is proportional to the current.
- It is instantaneous, so if the current disappears, the magnetic field disappears. In the
same way, if the current goes up, the magnetic field goes up.
- The current is the cause or the driving force of the magnetic field.
Finally, the unit of the magnetic field intensity is Ampere/meter.

If we have a magnetic field intensity H, it causes a magnetic flux density B. Their relation
is represented in the figure.
The relation is mostly linear until a certain point. What we see here is the hysteresis
effect in magnetic materials. In motors and this lecture in particular, we will not consider
the hysteresis relation, but we will mostly work with the linear relation.
That linear relation is represented by mu, which is the magnetic permeability. To
calculate the flux density, the magnetic intensity is multiplied by the permeability. This
means that the magnetic flux density is also a vector in the same direction of the
magnetic intensity.
The permeability is often decomposed into mu zero or the permeability of vacuum and
mu r is a relative permeability of the material. In air we will use mu zero, which is a very
small number, and as we will see in the following, in a motor we will have air.
The fact that mu zero is very small is not very good because a strong motor needs a
very high flux density (B). To do that, either a very high H (high current) is required or
have materials with very high permeability, such as in the case of iron. The unit of B is
Tesla.

Flux linkage: λ= NΦ

From the integration of the flux density of the whole close area, we obtain the magnetic
flux. Thus, the official formula is a double integral of B in the Area A.
Now we can go back to our ring example.
First, as we did before, we assume that in a cross section of the ring, the B is
approximately the same, i.e., constant. As such, the double integral can be simplified to
a multiplication of the magnetic flux density times the area.
Now we can combine all the formulas we have seen so far for B and H.
Then we can see that the flux is proportional to the current, where all other parameters
are constant: the length and cross section, the mu and the number of windings. The
current is the only variable that can change the flux.
Moreover, we can have a slightly different interpretation here and say that N times the
current is equal to a force. It is not a Newton force, but it is called mmf (magnetomotive
force) and it is expressed in Amperes, same that the back-emf was voltage, and it is the
cause of the magnetic flux.
The mmf is divided by a constant which is called Reluctance. A big reluctance appears
with a long path and a low mu.
Typically, we will use materials with low reluctance. For those, we will have a large cross
section (thick materials) and with a high permeability (such as ferromagnetic materials).
Low reluctance gives a high flux which is what we want.
Finally, if all turns of the conductor in the ring (or windings) are linked to the same flux, it
has a flux linkage or lambda.

Let’s add something else that will be very important for motors: The air gap.
In the figure, we have the situation as before with a ring in which a conductor is going
around it, but this time with a small air gap.
This is what we have in a motor (i.e, two parts (stator and rotor) which cannot touch, so
there is a gap).
What is the flux in this system?
First, let’s apply Ampere’s law, integrating along the ring.
As we need to integrate over a close loop, the current enclosed is equal to the magnetic
field intensity in the material times the length of the path plus the field intensity in the
gap times the length of the gap.
Next, the magnetic flux density in the material is mu of the material times the Hm. The B
of the gap is mu zero (because it is the air) times the Hg.
Now, we can include these in the previous equation.
Finally, we can have a look at the flux. The flux has to be the same throughout the close
system. If there is only one loop, there is only one flux.
One consideration: the flux density is different on the material than in the gap, as the
area is bigger but we will consider it nearly the same. This means that if the flux is the
same, the B is nearly the same, and the mus are very different (mu zero in the gap),
very high mu in the material, H has to be very low at the material and very high in the
air. This is a very important lesson: H shows the amount of effort required to go through
the material. High permeability requires low effort and with low permeability, the effort is
high.
In the extreme case, mu is considered extremely high (infinity) and this means that the
9
H is zero, no effort is required.
Finally, the flux is equal to the mmf divided by the reluctance (both of the material and
the gap). Which one is higher? The one of the air gap because it is difficult to get the
flux through the air gap. This also explains why we need a high H in the gap.
Lessons to learn:
• Φ is equal everywhere
• B and B are nearly considered equal
m g
• If µ >> µ then 𝐻 is very low.

Now it is time we talk about Inductances, which is something you most probably have
seen in other courses.
If we have again our ring example with the conductor winded around:
- We will first have a current.
- In order to obtain the magnetic field intensity H, we multiply by number of windings,
divided by the length of the material.
- The magnetic flux density B is calculated multiplying H by the permeability mu.
- The flux is obtained by multiplying the flux density by the area.
- And finally, if we multiply by the number of windings, we obtain the lambda or flux
linkage.
- So now, we can go from current to flux linkage if we multiply by this value. This value
is a constant, which is called inductance. So, the flux linkage is proportional to the
current. This means that it is instantaneous.
We can also see that the denominator of the inductance is the reluctance. So, the
inductance is the number of turns squared over the reluctance. Thus, it is a constant and
it relates the flux linkage with the current. Now, how can we compare it to the other
definition of inductance related to the voltage?

Lenz’ Law:
INDUCED CURRENTS PRODUCE
MAGNETIC FIELDS THAT TEND TO
OPPOSE THE FLUX CHANGES THAT
INDUCE THOSE CURRENTS
11
In this situation, we have a flux inside a coil. For an external reason, the flux starts to
change.
In such a case, we can use Faraday’s law, which says that if the flux is changing a
voltage is generated.
We can think about it the other way around, from the voltage perspective: When we
have a coil such as this one, we can apply a voltage and a current is generated. This
current creates a flux (Ampere’s law). However, the flux cannot change immediately,
because the electrons need to change direction. A voltage is fixed, but the current
cannot change quickly. What we will see is that the change of the flux (from the change
of the current ) will generate a voltage that goes in the opposite direction of e. This is
related to the law of Lenz.

12
Now let’s dig a bit deeper. We apply a voltage e and the current wants to increase. So,
the flux increases and it creates a voltage, which opposes the applied voltage.
Across the first winding there is a voltage opposing, also at the second, the third, etc.
These voltages act as a counterforce and will make the current to slowly increase.
Next, we can see it in the formulas. First, we have the relation between the current and
the linkage. The current is N/L times the flux. Now, we add the Faraday one, which says
that if the flux changes it creates a voltage. Again proportional with a number of
windings.
By the way, Faraday works in both directions: a change in flux generates a voltage as
well as a change of a voltage generates a flux.
Now we can combine both formulas and we obtain a relation between the voltage and
the current that it should look familiar to you as you might have applied it in other
courses. This formula says that you get a voltage equal to the inductance times the
change of the current. So if you need your current to change quickly, you need a high
voltage. Also, if the current does not change, the voltage will be zero. Tip to take:
Inductive means the current cannot change quickly!
12
Time variant essence of e(t), i(t) and Φ
13
Voltage, flux and current can vary in time following a sinusoidal curve. As we can see
here, flux and current are ALWAYS in phase (remember that they are proportional). The
voltage is the time derivative of the flux, this means it is 90 degrees dephased. In the
figure it means that if the voltage is maximum, the flux is zero and viceversa. If the flux
increases, the voltage decreases.
13
Question: How is the current in these cases?
e(t) e(t)
t t
i(t) i(t)
t t
14
Let’s see these two examples.
In the first one, the voltage is first positive, then it goes to zero, it turns negative and
back to zero again. In this case, the current will increase linearly while the voltage is
positive, it will be constant when the voltage is zero and decrease with the negative
voltage. If the two areas are the same, the current will go back to zero.
In the second case, the voltage is constant and positive. This means that the current will
increase in theory until infinity but there is a limitation, either from the resistor of the coil
or due to the saturation of the magnetic field (the hysteresis effect). We will try to avoid
this situation in a motor.
14
Leakage and magnetizing inductances
15
Here we see one more concept: leakage. Until now we have only discussed ideal
situations where all of the magnetic flux goes through the core. It can happen (it
happens) that some part of the flux goes through the air gap in the middle. This happens
because the reluctance in the air is not infinity. Therefore, part of the flux goes through
the air in the middle. This is called leakage. This is one of the losses which needs to be
taken care into account when analyzing a motor model (you can check it in the first slide
of the course and in the next slide).
15
The leakage circuit representation and the motor
16
Now finally, we can go back to the circuit representation. We apply voltage to the coil,
and we will have the voltage that is loss as leakage and the voltage used at the air gap
em (t) which is the one we want for the motor. So, most of the voltage will appear where
we want it, but there will be some losses across that leakage inductance. This is just a
model, there is no inductor there but it is represented as the losses. In the second figure
we go to where we started at the lesson today. By placing the losses (leakage) out of the
emf, we can consider the flux around the gap ideal. Em is the useful voltage that will
generate the flux in the gap. There is some leakage before and we include a resistance
representing the resistance of the very long wire of the windings. If you compare this to
the motor model, it is clear to see that it is the same. Em represents the back-emf,
resistor is the cable and the inductance the leakage.
