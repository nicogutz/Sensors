Introduction to Sensors
Property:
• Position
• Acceleration
• Force/pressure
• Temperature
“A sensor is a device that receives a signal or stimulus
and responds with an electrical signal.”
What does the device need to respond? Output:
• Active: Requires external source • Voltage, Current
• Passive: Self-generating • Resistance, Capacitance
4
Let’s go to the definition of sensor. It is a device that receives a signal or
stimulus and responds with an electrical signal. We can analysethe different
parts of this definition:
What do we mean by a signal or stimulus? We mean a property, such as the
position, acceleration, force/pressure, temperature, etc.
What is the electrical signal? Voltage, current, resistance capacitance
And it says that it receives and responds, how? It will be in two manners:
actively, which need a source of power to respond, and passively, which
simply detects and responds to some input of the physical environment.
Active system example: a radar emits radio waves and then measures what
is returned. It is emitting what is going to measure afterwards.
Passive system example: No emitter to measure, it is relying on whatever is
already in the environment. For instance, this is something that happens on
satellite.

Here some examples of sensors
5
Example: sensors in a process control
6
The application of sensors in a typical control loop is such as shown in this
figure.
If the physical property to be controlled is the temperature.
The output of the temperature sensor is conditioned (transformed to an easy
scale to compute).
Then digitalized by an ADC (analogue digital converter) (4 to 20mA
transmitter).
The microcontroller or host computer determines if the temperature is above
or below the desired value, and outputs a digital word to the DAC (digital
analogue converter).
The DAC output is conditioned and drives the actuator (a heater in this
case).
6
Example: Smart sensors in digital interfaces
7
Digital techniques are becoming more popular in processing sensor outputs
in data acquisition, process control and measurements. Thus, it is nowadays
common to build what is called a smart sensor, which includes an A/D
converter as well as microcontroller programmability (8-bit microcontroller is
sufficient). As such, a smart sensor can perform actions related to self-
calibration, linearization and others. A smart sensor can then be interfaced
directly to an industrial network.
7
Detail on smart sensor structure
8
The basic building blocks of a “smart sensor” are shown here. It is
constructed by multiple ICs where each of these have their own purpose. On
an even smarter version, the three different ICs could be integrated in one
single chip (a MicroConverter–see figure 1-4 in the book)

General Characteristics of sensors
• Static (they do not change):
Transfer function, Span (Full-Scale Input), Full-Scale Output, Accuracy,
Calibration, Hysteresis, Non-linearity, Saturation, Repeatability, Dead Band,
Resolution, Output impedance, Excitation
• Dynamic (they do change):
First order sensors, Second order sensors, etc.
9
From the input to the output, a sensor may have several conversion steps
before it produces an electrical signal.
However, in this session we will discuss sensors like a black box without
taking into account these conversion steps. Thus, the remainder of this
session we discuss the general characteristics or the relationships between
its output signal and input stimulus. Here a description of the characteristics
we will discuss. First of all, we can distinguish between static characteristics
(they do not change, they are related to the steady state) and dynamic
characteristics (they change over time).
9
Statistic Characteristics: Transfer function
𝑂 = 𝐹(𝑖) Linear : 𝑂=𝑎+𝑏𝑖 (𝑎:𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑝𝑡;𝑏:𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 𝑜𝑟 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦)
O: Output signal (S in the book)
i: Input stimulus (s in the book)
F: Transfer Function
Logaritmic : 𝑂 =𝑎+𝑏ln𝑖 Exponential : 𝑂=𝑎𝑒(cid:3038)(cid:3046)
Other, e.g., Power function: 𝑂 =𝑎 +𝑎 𝑖(cid:3038), higher order polynomial
(cid:2868) (cid:2869)
10
There is always an ideal or theoretical output signal-input stimulus relation.
You can see this relation in the first equation. Please pay attention that in the
slides I am naming output O and input I, while in the book they are output-
signal S and input-stimulus s. I decided to change the naming to avoid the
confusion with the Laplace variable s.
The output O, will be one of the characteristics of the output signal. It may be
amplitude, frequency or phase (depending on the required property).
The ideal function may be stated in the form of a table of values, a graph or
a mathematical equation.
An ideal (theoretical) output-input relationship is characterized by the transfer
function and it establishes the dependence between the electrical output
signal and the input stimulus.
However, a sensor may have such a transfer function that none of these
approximations fit sufficiently well. In that case, a higher-order polynomial is
often required.
How does this transfer function look like? It might be a linear connection or a
nonlinear dependence. In many cases, the relationship is uni-dimensional
(the output vs the input).
Here we can find some examples:
First, a linear relationship can be seen here. A and b are constants, and a is
called the intercept (output at zero input) and b is the slope or sensitivity.
We can also have other relationships which can be very successful in
calculating the real stimulus out of the measured signal.
These are the examples of logarithmic, exponential or even a power
function.

Static Characteristics: Transfer Function –Nonlinearities
• Sensitivity b not a fixed number
(cid:3031)(cid:3016)((cid:3036) )
For any particular input value 𝑖 𝑏 = (cid:3116)
(cid:2868)
(cid:3031)(cid:3036)
• Piece-wise linear approximation
11
It can also happen that the relation is a non-linear one. For a nonlinear TF, b
is not a fixed number, at any particular input value i0, it can be defined as the
derivative of the TF related to the input variable.
In many cases, a nonlinear sensor may be considered linear over a limited
range. Over the extended range, several straight lines may model a
nonlinear transfer function. To determine whether a function can be
represented by a linear model, the incremental variables are introduced for
the input while observing the output. A difference between the actual
response and a linear model is compared with the specified accuracy limits.
11
Static Characteristics: Transfer Function –2 Dimensions
𝑉 =𝐺(𝑇(cid:2872) − 𝑇(cid:2872))
(cid:2868) (cid:3029) (cid:3020)
b=𝑑𝑉 ⁄𝑑𝑇 =4𝐺𝑇(cid:2871)
(cid:2868) (cid:3029) (cid:3029)
12
Of course, a tfmight have more than one dimension when the sensor’s
output is influenced by more than one input stimuli. An example is the
transfer function of a thermal radiation (infrared) sensor. It connects to
temperatures (Tb or absolute temperature of an object and Ts, the absolute
temperature of the sensor with the output voltage V0. How would we
determine the sensitivity respect to the object’s temperature? With the partial
derivative.
One final note, a transfer function represents the input-to-output relationship.
However, when a sensor is used for measuring a stimulus (in a feedback
loop), an inversed function will be used (output-to-input). If the transfer
function is linear, the inversed function is very easy to compute. When
nonlinear it is more complex and the analytical solution will not lend a
reasonably simple data processing. In these cases, we will need to use
approximation techniques.
12
Static Characteristics: Span or Full-Scale Input
O
• Dynamic range of stimuli which may be converted
by a sensor
• For sensors with a large span we use decibels
𝑑𝐵=10log𝑃 ⁄𝑃 𝐹𝑜𝑟 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟
(cid:2869) (cid:2870)
𝑑𝐵 =20 log𝑖 ⁄𝑖 (𝐹𝑜𝑟 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒,𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡,𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒)
(cid:3023) (cid:2869) (cid:2870)
i
13
The dynamic range of stimuli which may be converted by a sensor. Thus, it is
the highest possible input value that can be applied to the sensor without
causing an unacceptable large inaccuracy. For sensors with a large span we
can use decibels. A decibel scale represents signal magnitudes by much
smaller numbers, which in many cases is far more convenient. It may
represent a low-level signals with high resolution while compressing high-
level numbers. It works like a microscope for small magnitudes and for a
telescope for big ones.

A very important characteristic of a sensor is accuracy which actually means
inaccuracy. It is measured as a highest deviation of a value represented by
the sensors from the ideal or true value at its input.

17
If we repeat the previous experiment and every time we observe the same
error (0.5mm) we may say that the sensor has a systematic inaccuracy of
0.5mm over a 10-mm span. As there is often a random component present,
the systematic error might be represented as a mean value.
In the figure we can see the ideal or theoretical TF (as a linear TF). Well, in
the real world, the sensor will perform with some kind of imperfection. The
thick line represents the real transfer function (not linear or monotonic).
While it is normal that the real TF does not follow the ideal TF, it is required
that all runs of the real transfer function fall within the limits of a specific
accuracy. These permissive limits differ from the ideal one by means of
delta.
For instance in the figure we can consider the input stimulus x. Ideally, we
would expect this to correspond to value Y. Instead, the real point will
respond to point Z, which gives output Y’. Y’ will correspond to z’ in the ideal
transfer function, which would relate to input value x’. This value x’ is smaller
than x, where x-x’ = delta. Thus, the imperfections in the transfer function
leads to a measurement error of –delta.
17
Static Characteristics: (In)Accuracy (2)
O
Tip 1: The inaccuracy rating is represented as:
• Directly in terms of measured value (Δ), or
• In % of input span (full scale), or
• In terms of output signal
Multipoint calibration Tip 2: In modern sensors, accuracy is often
accuracy replaced by the value of uncertainty which
encompasses all distorting effects (systematic
and random)
i
18
The previous slide showed an extreme case. Actually, very often the
accuracy limits follow much more closely the real transfer function. This can
be done by means of multi-point calibration, where the accuracy limits are
not set in relation with the ideal (theoretical) transfer function but rather the
calibration curve. Then, the permissive limits become narrower as they are
geared specifically to the calibrated unit.
Two final comments regarding the accuracy.
Accuracy can be measured directly in terms of the measured value, in
percentage of the input span or in terms of the output signal.
Also, in modern sensor a value of uncertainty is often given, as it provides
both systematic as random errors.
18
Static Characteristics: Calibration
• Individual transfer function needs to be found
• Determination of specific variables that describe the overall transfer function
• Before calibration we need to know the mathematical model:
Linear
o
Exponential
o
Etc.
o
• How to calibrate will depend on the model.
19
If the sensor’s manufacturer’s tolerances and tolerances of the interface
circuit are broader than the required system accuracy, a calibration is
required.
For example, if we need to measure temperature with accuracy of +-0.5°C
and we have a sensor with a +/-1°C accuracy. Does it mean that we cannot
use it? No, it can be used, but we need to calibrate the sensor.
What does calibration means? It means that we need to find the individual
transfer function or to determine the specific variables that describe the
overall transfer function. The calibration will depend on the mathematical
model of the sensor.

Static Characteristics: Calibration of Linear Sensors
Temperature sensor example:
• 𝑣 = 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑡
𝑣:𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒;𝑡:𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒;𝑏:𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦;𝑎=𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡 (𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠)
• How to determine a and b?
Subject sensor to 2 temperatures (𝑡 and 𝑡 )
o (cid:2869) (cid:2870)
2 voltages are obtained:
o
• 𝑣 = 𝑎+𝑏𝑡 (𝑣 −𝑣 )
(cid:2869) (cid:2869) (cid:2869) (cid:2870)
𝑏= 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎 =𝑣 −𝑏𝑡
• 𝑣 = 𝑎+𝑏𝑡 𝑡 −𝑡 (cid:2869) (cid:2869)
(cid:2870) (cid:2870) (cid:2869) (cid:2870)
To compute the temperature from the output voltage a measured voltage is
o
inserted into the inversed equation
((cid:3049)(cid:2879)(cid:3028))
• 𝑡 =
(cid:3029)
20
For instance is the sensor is linear, the calibration will mean to determine the
constants a and b.
As we have two constants, we will need to measure the voltage at two
different temperatures.
In some fortunate cases, one of the constants may be specified with a
sufficient accuracy so no calibration of that particular constant may be
needed.
20
Static Characteristics: Calibrations of non-linear sensors
1. More than two points, depending on the model of the transfer function
2. Model as a piecewise approximation of linear parts
21
For nonlinear functions, more than two points may be required, depending
on the mathematical model of the transfer function. Any transfer function
may be modeled by a polynomial, and depending on required accuracy, the
number of the calibration points could be selected.
Another way may be to use piecewise approximation. Then for each of the
pieces, a and b can be discovered,

22
It is the inaccuracy permitted by the manufacturer when a sensor is
calibrated in the factory. It is of systematic nature and it shifts the accuracy
for each stimulus point by a constant.
22
Static Characteristics: Hysteresis
O
Deviation of the sensor’s output at a
specified point of the input signal when it is
approached from the opposite direction.
i
23
Deviation of the sensor’s output at a specified point of the input signal when
it is approached from the opposite direction.
Example: A displacement sensor when the object moves from left to right
produces a voltage that differs by 20mV from that when the object goes from
right to left. If the sensitivity of the sensor is 10mV/mm, the hysteresis error
in terms of displacement unitsis2mm.
23
Static Characteristics: Nonlinearity
"Linearity” when not accompanied by a statement explaining what
sort of straight line it is referring to, is meaningless.
It is the maximum deviation L of a real transfer function from the
approximation line.
Terminal points Leastsquares
24
Nonlinearity error is specified for sensors whose transfer function may be
approximated by a straight line. It is the maximum deviation L of a real
transfer function from the approximation line. There are several manners to
specify the non-linearity:
One way, shown in a is to use the terminal points: to determine output values
at smallest and highest points and to draw a straight line through. Here, near
the terminal points the error is the smallest possible.
Another way, shown in b, is to use the least squares method. We would
measure several output values at input values and then we use linear
regression to determine the best fitting line with a and b.
24
Static Characteristics: Saturation or operating limits
25
Every sensor has its operating limits. Even if it is considered linear, at some
levels of the input stimuli, its output signal no longer will be responsive. A
further increase in stimulus does not produce a desirable output. The sensor
exhibits a span-end nonlinearity or saturation.
25
Static Characteristics: Repeatability
Inability of a sensor to represent the same value under identical conditions
26
A repeatability error is caused by the inability of a sensor to represent the
same value under identical conditions. It is expressed as the maximum
difference between output readings as determined by two calibrating cycles,
unless otherwise specified.
26
Static Characteristics: Dead band
Insensitivity of a sensor in a specific range of inputs signal
27
The dead band is the insensitivity of a sensor in a specific range of inputs
signal. In that input, the output remains a certain value (often zero). A clear
example is a diode.
27
Static Characteristics: Resolution
Resolution describes the smallest increments
of stimulus which can be sensed.
28
28
Static Characteristics: Output Impedance
29
The output impedance is important to know to better interface a sensor with
electronic circuits. It is connected either in parallel or in series. For a voltage
connection, a sensor is preferable with lower Zoutand the Zin should be as
high as practical.
29
Static Characteristics: Excitation
• Electrical signal needed for the active sensor operation
• Variations in the excitation may alter the sensor transfer function and cause
output errors.
• To much excitation can heat up the sensor and if not destroyed, give less
accuracy.
30

Dynamic Characteristics (1)
• Zero-order sensor: 𝑂 𝑡 = 𝑎 +𝑏 𝑖 (𝑡)
(cid:3031)(cid:3016)((cid:3047))
• First order sensor: 𝑏 +𝑏 𝑂 𝑡 = 𝑖(𝑡)
(cid:2869) (cid:2868)
(cid:3031)(cid:3047)
31
Under static conditions, a sensor is fully described by its transfer function,
span, calibration, etc.
However, when an input varies, a sensor response will not follow with perfect
fidelity at least not instantly. If you remember from systems and control
theory, we could analyze control systems in dynamic mode (when the output
changes in time) and in static mode. This is related to this as the sensor
requires some “warm up” time to follow the change in output.
The input-output relation will be described through a constant-coefficient
linear differential equation. Then, the sensor’s dynamic characteristics can
be studied by evaluating such an equation. Depending on the sensor design,
the differential equation can be of a different order.
First, a zero-order sensor is characterized by the relationship for a linear
transfer function where the input and output dependent on time. Thus, a
zero-order sensor responds instantaneously. It does not need any dynamic
characteristic.
Second, a first-order sensor incorporates one energy component. Thus, the
relationship between input and output is a first order differential equation. A
typical example is a temperature sensor for which the energy storage is a
thermal capacity. These sensors will be specified by means of the frequency
response in where the cut-off frequency and the -3dB amplitude will be
provided. It is also possible to provide it with the time response that as you
might remember from last year is and exponential where tau will give the
response time. Tau will give us the time in which the amplitude has reached
63% of the value.

A second-order differential equation describes a sensor that incorporates
two energy storage components. An example of these is an accelerometer
that incorporate a mass and a spring.
