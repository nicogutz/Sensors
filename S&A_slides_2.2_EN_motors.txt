motors bythemselvesare more expensivethanAC motors, specially
becauseof safetyregulations, but theyrequirelesscomplex electronics.
Thustheyare overall cheaper. However, nowadaysas electronics become
cheaper, AC motors are increasingin popularity. Oneexampleis theelectric

Structure of a DC machine

Thisslide shows a 3D view of a DC motor. We have thestator witha
permanent magnet, whichin traditional DC itdoes notmove. It createsthe
magneticflux.
Inside, we have therotor rotatingaroundtheshaft. We canalsoseethe
windingsof theconductors thatgo back andforthin therotor. Whilewe
cannotseeitin thepicture, thereare conductors parallel totheshaftmoving
throughthemagneticfield.
Now, howdo we generatea currentthroughtheconductors thatmove? For
thatwe usebrushes.
The currentcomesin, thenwe have a brush pushinga segment in therotor
throughthemotor windings. Then, theysendthecurrentthroughthe
windingsanditcomesout in theotherdirection.
The problemof thissystem is thewearingout of thebrushes. Aftera while,

Moreover, becauseof brushesconnectedtosegments, itcreatessparksso

Here we canseetwopossibleconfigurationsof thestator. We canhave
eitherpermanent magnets(a) or a field winding whosecurrentcanbevaried
toachieveanadditionaldegreeof control. Independent on thetype, theywill
functionin thesamemanner.
9
Operating principles of DC machines: Flux
10
Here we cango more intothedetails of thefunctioningof theDC motors.
We first have a northanda southpoleproducingflux from left to right in the
stator and going through the rotor.
Important is again that through the air gap the flux is radial. This is
something that we saw in the previous lecture and that here appears again.
The magnetic field is radial through the air gap. This can be seen in the
figure b. The flux does not go in straight lines but following this figure b.
What do we also see here? We see the current source which is connected
to the rotor by means of the two brushes b1 and b2 on two segments S1 and
S2, where S1 is just connected to one conductor (for simplicity). The
conductor goes parallel to the shaft towards the back side and then back to
the other side, where it is connected to segment S2,and brush b2. In this
way we have a closed loop. Thus, this is how the current is sent through the
rotor winding.
In c we see what we already saw in the previous lecture. The B is positive in
one side, negative in the other. The transition region will be ignored for the
calculations. Now, let’s see what happens when the rotor starts to move. The
brushes will stay in their place but the segments will move.
10
Operating principles of DC machines: Torque
FIGURE 7.7
11
The electronic circuit and the brushes b1 and b2 do not move, but the
segments rotate with the rotor and so will the conductors in the rotor. Let’s
see first without the rotation (a).
The current goes through the brush, the segment and the wire away from us
and it comes back to us from the other side through the wire, the segment,
the brush and back to the electrical circuit. From this current we get a torque,
which means we get rotation.
The rotor rotates and 90 degrees further we get the situation in b. At that
position, suddenly there is no current through your conductors. Why is that?
The two segments have rotated 90 degrees and as a consequence the
current goes through the brush, through both segments then through the
other brush and back to the power supply. Thus, very briefly there is a
shortcut and there is no current through the conductors. As a consequence,
there is no torque.
Thanks to inertia, the conductors move further and we get to position c (90
degrees further), where S2 is connected to b1 and S1 to b2 (inverted). In this
case, the current goes in the same way as before, but conductor 1 is now in
the position of 2 and viceversa. So, they are 180 degrees further, noticing
that now the current direction has changed. This is because we have
commutation (changing the direction of the current). And why do we need
this? So that the torque continues in the same direction. When we are close
to the north pole flux goes in while in south pole it goes out.
11
Operating principles of DC
machines: Wave forms
• e and i of a conductor reverse
polarity at 90 degrees because of
the magnetic field
• Torque is momentarily zero at 90
degrees because of the shortcut.
• Overall voltage E is also affected
by the shortcut
12
So, what are the consequences? E and I of the conductor change polarity as
we can see in the first figure, because the magnetic field changes direction
for the commutation. As such, the torque continues in the same direction
where there is a drop at 90 degrees. This is shown very exaggerated for
illustration, in real life the drop is very short. As a consequence, the induced
voltage also gets a drop (the shortcut) but in general, the totally induced
voltage will always have the same polarity. While the voltage of one
conductor will change polarity, the overall voltage will not. So, important to
take: At the momentof reversing the current, voltage and torque are briefly
zero.
12
How to reduce the size of the shortcut? (1)
13
So, how can we reduce the size of the shortcut? One way is to have multiple
conductors, i.e., having motor windings at different places, such as in this
figure a. The trick is to have different conductors or pair of conductors and
when we do the commutationwe do not need to commutate all of them at
the same time.
13
How to reduce the size of the shortcut? (2)
14
In this position, conductors 1 and 3 are at the position where it needs to
change direction, but there will not be a 100% loss as the other conductors
are still working.

Same here

How to reduce the size of the shortcut?-Wave forms
16
As a consequence, torque and induced voltage do not go to zero at the
commutation points. The most important message of this slide is that you
know that there are ways to avoid or to reduce the deep in induced voltage
and torque.
16
In a more extreme case…
An 8-coil winding
reduces the ripple even
more.
Also note that there are
always two parallel
paths.
17
We can even go further to a 16-conductor system, to be able to reduce the
ripple. Here, instead of 2 segments, we have 8 segments, which helps about
the ripples. So, there are always 6 pairs with current and 2 pairs commuting,
so a maximum of 20 percent loss.

(cid:3028) (cid:3006) (cid:3040) (cid:3006) 2 (cid:3033)
18
Now let’s have a look at the equations. First, we will go to an idealized
situation in which there is always a current, so we do not take the ripples into
account, i.e., the change of direction is instantaneous. This means we have
a number of conductors at the left size where the current goes away from us
and the same number of conductors at the right side where the current goes
towards us.
Now, the two formulas that really matter over here are the torque and the
induced voltage, where the formulas you can remember from the previous
lecture.
Here, the machine constants are written in a slightly different way but the
concept is the same. The most important things are that kt and keare the
machine constant in N.mand that they depend on the machine. So, as we
already said a couple of times during the lectures, Torque is proportional to
current and back-emf is proportional to angular velocity, where the
proportionality constant is the machine constant. keand kt are the same.
18
Operating principles of DC machines: Armature reaction
19
One last important detail. Remember we have two magnetic fields in the
motor:
Magnetic field in the stator (permanent magnets) which we will look at when
we analyseforces (like Lorentz)
But, due to the currents going through the conductors in the rotor we will get
a magnetic field (Ampere)
These magnetic fields will add up and will create a higher magnetic field on
the top and lower at the bottom. There are ways to compensating these.
19
Compensating the armature reaction
20
For instance, we can add additional windings to try to compensate the flux.
But we will ignore this for the remaining of this course.

Now, we have again the motor model. We have the resistor related to the
motor windings.
Secondly, the motor behaves inductively (currents running through a
conductor in a magnetic field), and that is why we have La. It models the
behaviourof the motor.
Third, we have the back-emf, the voltage induced by the movement of the
motor. The motor returns a voltage, so we have a voltage source and the
voltage depends on the speed of the motor. The purpose is that in steady
state most of the applied voltage will be in this back-emf over here. So, in
this example, vais the applied voltage by the electronic system. Let’s move
to the equations:
First, we have a direct application of Kirchhoff's law. Vaequals the back emf
plus the voltage dropped at the resistor (Ohm) and the voltage dropped at
the inductor.
The second one gives a relation between an electrical and a mechanical
property. The back-emf relates to the mechanical speed of the motor.
The third equation gives another relation between an electrical and a
mechanical property. The torque is related to the electrical current. By means
of the machine constant
The fourth equation is a purely mechanical one. It says that the angular
acceleration is torque divided by inertia. We can relate this to Newton (F=
m.a). There it is for a linear movement. In this case, we are talking about
rotational movement: the mass becomes inertia, the force becomes the
mechanical torque and the acceleration becomes an angular acceleration. It
is very important that you know these equation and that you see how they
relate to one another.
Let’s assume that the motor is not moving, and we connect a battery to it
(like for a small toy). Initially there is no back-emf because the motor is not
21
moving. As the current slowly increases from zero, initially the eais
zero, the voltage dropped on the resistor will be zero and all the voltage
will be concentrated around the inductor. As the current increases, a
small voltage at the resistor will appear and if there is a current, there
will be a torque. Due to the torque, the motor will move and as a result
the back-emf will also increase. As such, the back-emf increases and so
does the voltage on the resistor and the voltage at the inductor
decreases. At a certain moment there will be an equilibrium where no
voltage is dropped in the inductor.

This equilibrium is the DC motor in steady state. What does this mean? That
nothing changes in time: the current does not change anymore so the
derivative is 0. Also, there is no change in the angular velocity (a constant).
This means that the torques (Tem, TL) are equal or in equilibrium so the net
torque is 0 (i.e., the TL and Temare constant). Moreover, the back-emf is
equal to the applied voltage minus the voltage dropped at the resistor.
Keep in mind that the second component is as small as possible as it will
heat up the motor. In general, the back-emf is almost equal to your applied
voltage. This brings us to a very nice insight meaning that the applied
voltage will determine the speed.
Now, another thing we can do is to add something on the mechanical
properties. We get this equation relating the speed omega to the torque and
this relation is what we call the motor characteristic, which create the curves
in the next slide.

If we have keand Ra, we can get these curves. It is important to know that
this relates torque to speed. This relation comes from the electrical property.
Let’s interpret these characteristics. First of all, we see that for every applied
voltage we get a different characteristic. This is an intuitive concept, as the
applied voltage leads to a higher speed, the higher applied voltage in the
characteristic leads to a higher omega.
Another thing obtained is that by a higher torque you get a lower speed. This
has to do with the load, if you have a heavier load it will slow down the motor.
It is also related to the resistance, which means that if the resistance is
higher you get a steeper slope. A higher torque leads to a higher current
therefore a higher voltage drop on the resistance and the steeper slope. This
is again, steady state behavior, no inductance.

Here there is a small exercise. First, the angular velocity at 0 torque, which
means zero current. So, the applied voltage is equal to the back-emfand the
velocity is the Eadivided by the machine constant: so200 rad/s. Then the
slope, the decline over here. So, at 8 N.m, what is the drop in speed? This is
proportional to the drop in voltage. The drop in voltage is equal to the
Resistor times the current and the current is related to the torque by means
of the machine constant. So, if the torque is 8 Nm, we can calculate the
current, and from it the drop of voltage.
