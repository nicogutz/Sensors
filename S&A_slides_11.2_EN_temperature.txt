Here there is a summary of the most used temperature. We will discuss:
thermocouple, the resistive temperature detector, the thermistor and the
semiconductor sensor.

Thermocouples: Intro
Thermo-electric effect = Seebeck effect
= generating a voltage over the junction
when T>0°K
In standard operation of a thermocouple there are 2 junctions
Normal operation :1 junction at 0°C
4
Let’s start with the thermocouples!
Why do they exist?
They exist because If we melt two material (metals) together, we have a
seebeckeffect.
This is not a soldering effect.
This seebeckeffect shows that there is going to be a voltage generated over
the junction when the temperature is higher than 0 Kelvin, which is -273 C.
This means that every junction generates a voltage. This can be harmful to
some equipment, as once we have two metals from a different composition
that get melted together, there will be a voltage generated. This voltage is
however relatively small.
In most standard operations we will need two of these junctions.
We will go from metal A to metal B (first junction) and then from metal B to
metal A second junction. Thus, we end up of two of the same materials.
Because of the voltage difference, one of the junctions will be kept at 0C.
Why would this be? To measure relative more robust measurements.

Thermocouples: Most relevant junctions

5
Here you can see a list of the most relevant junctions. Each is named by a
letter, so that we do not need the name the whole composition when buying
them.
The most popular thermocouple is the J. This is Iron-constantan, it is cheap,
it has a low temperature range but a very high sensitivity. This sensitivity is
defined at 0 degrees C.
The voltage increases with the temperaturebut it will not be linear. Thus, we
will need some tables to understand the relation between the temperature
and the output voltage. It might be possible to have a piece wise linear
approximation but by definition, thisis not a linear relation.
The second popular thermocouple is the Chromel-Alumel(K), which is more
expensive but has a very big temperature range, at a cost of a lower
sensitivity.
This is standard behaviour: as the range increases, the sensitivity
decreases. As the amount of voltage generated is the same, the bigger the
range, the smaller the sensitivity.
Another interesting but more expensive one, is the S. Which has a yet bigger
range and smaller sensitivity.
5
Thermocouples: output voltages vs temperature
6
Here you can see plotted the relation between temperature and output
voltage for these three cases (J, K, S).
J has the smallest temperature range but the highest sensitivity.
These look like straight lines. However, if we would take the first derivative of
the voltage related to the temperature (the sensitive or seebeckcoefficient)
we can see that this is not the case.
6
Thermocouples: Sensitivity (first derivative)
7
This we can see here. If the voltage-temperature curves were straight lines,
the first derivative would be a flat horizontal line and, they would be linear
sensors.
However, as we can see, they are not linear.
They come however close. For instance, the S is around 10, K is about 40
and J about 55.
In summary, we cannot find a formula to calculate the temperature from the
voltage. The only thing we can do is to calibrate themand the behavior is
reproducible. Every S thermocouple will generate the same Seebeckvoltage
with the same temperature. This means, we need just tables to calculate
this.
7
Thermocouples: Basic measurement systems
8
What is this voltage? We can see it in A. The voltage is the thermoelectric
EMF. In this case, we have only one junction, so we have an absolute value.
We can also have a configuration like in B, where we have two junctions. We
put one thermocouple at low temperature, one at high temperature, we have
two voltages, we get a current and we generate power. Unfortunately, this
power is very verysmall.
Now, why would we have these two junctions. In V1, we will have a junction
of A and B while in V2 we will have a junction of B and A. This means that we
have two of the same material but opposite. If they are both at the same
temperature, they will generate exactly the samevoltage and the current
through R will be 0. Which means, no voltage is measured.
That is why, that in the measurement setup ( C ), we will need two junctions
for one thermocouple. One of the junctions will be kept at 0 degrees, the
other one will have the temperature that we want to measure.
This is still not the final setup. Actually, ifwe connect a data acquisition
system, it will be connected by means of a metal cable (copper).
This means that we actually haveyet two more junctions: the original T1, T2
and the ones with the copper T3 and T4.
And I want to know the temperature as one of them. Is this possible? Well, if
we keep T3 and T4 at the same temperature, they are junctions composed
by the metal and copper. They will generate the same voltage but opposite,
so they cancel each-others. This means that we can measure the
temperature of junction T2 with this type of system.
8
Thermocouples: Measurement circuit
9
Thus, here we can see the full system. We will have one junction at 0
degrees Celsius (T2) and we can measure in T1. We will have the same
composition of the material then (two junctions). Of course, the output
voltage is not linear with temperature. It is calibrated with the voltage at 0
degrees Celsius. Thus, we are measuring voltages at 0 degrees Celsius.
The problem is how do we keep one of the junctions at 0 degrees? It is not
really possibleto just carry a cold bath around, right?
9
Thermocouples: cold junction compensation (1)
10
This means we need some extra component for temperature compensation.
Suppose we replace the second junction (theoretically at 0 degrees) for
another isothermal block which is for instance at 20 degrees. What will
happen? We will actually makean error, right? Because this T2 generates a
voltage related to the 20 degrees and not to the 0 degrees that we want. Is
this really a problem? We will need to compensate it.
We will need a temperature compensation circuit so that the voltage appears
to be the one of 0 degrees.
As this temperature can change, we will need a way to measure the
temperature and make sure we are compensating for the correct one. That is
why we need a second temperature sensor.
Here you can find the equation.
Why don’t we just use the temperature sensor of the isothermal block as the
temperature sensor?
Well, this temp sensor will usually have a very small range (0 to 40 degrees,
for instance) and it will not be suitable to the requirements of the
thermocouple (temp of 0 to 1000 degrees).
10
Thermocouples: cold junction compensation (2)
11
We can simplify the system further. Why not put the two thermocouples
(metal A and copper) (metal B and copper) in the isothermal block? We could
compensate for them at once. We will need to know the temperature of those
thermocouples in order tocompensate it.
11
Thermocouples: cold junction compensation – TMP35
12
This is the principle used in this circuit. The TMP35 has a small rangeand it
can be used to measure the isothermal block and compensate it. You do not
need to know this by heart, just more or less recognize what the elements
are.
It will get an output of 10mV/C. Moreover, the system is quasilinear.
12
Thermocouples: Cold junction compensation –AD594
13
We can go one step further and actually justbuy the whole compensation
system in an integrated chip.
We could use a Type J or Type K.

Best feature Low-Voltage output
14
Thus, the thermocouple has a very large range, it is very accurate, not linear
but repeatable.
It is passive, which is very cool, but it requires the cold junction
compensation. It has a low-voltage output.
14
Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD)
• Resistance changes with temperature
• Pure metal
• Platinum is most popular
• PT100 has a nominal resistance of 100 Ω at 0°C
15
This one is an active sensor, more simplistic in electronic requirements than
the thermocouples.
The resistance temperature detector or RTD is a wire of pure metal. Usually
we use platinum.
We take a platinum wire,we increase the temperature and the resistance
increases.
If at 0 Celsius, the resistance is 100 ohm, we have the PT100. Thus, a
PT1000, would be a sensor that has 1kOhm at 0 degree Celsius.
These sensors are not linear againbut they are very predictable.
This means that we can make very accurate measurements as we will know
the calibration.
15
Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD): Temperature range
• Very wire range: -200 °C to +850°C
• The construction is the limiting factor:
Different expansion rates of the resistive material and the
o
support will suffer the “strain gage” effect
16
They have a very high temperature range, meaning we can have a broad
variety of applications.
Can we use the RTD immediately at those temperatures?
Actually not, because we need to attach the platinum wire to a support, to be
able to measure it.
Thus, the limiting factor of these sensors will be the support material. If the
support changes dimensions, it will get a strain gage effect (elongation). This
could provoke a resistance change bigger than the one provoked by the
temperature and would cause noise.
Moreover, if we solder the sensors, we could also have problems with the
melting of the soldering.
Thus, depending on the support and how the platinum is attached, we will
have different ranges.
16
Resistance Temperature Detector: Thin film RTD’s
• Low cost to produce
• Have a limited temperature range due
to “strain gauge” effect.
• These elements can only operate up to
300°C.
17
This first example has a limiting temperature of around 300 degrees.
This is due to this strain gage effect that we were discussing.
As platinum is very expensive, we can make them as thin as possible with a
certain film and a ceramic support.
The ceramic support could change dimensions (expansion) with the
temperature,thus, we will measure also the strain gage effect.
This is in any case a very useful system. For instance, in ovens or fridges
where we need to measure the temperature very accurately for a certain
limited range.
They are also very low cost!
17
Resistance Temperature Detector: Wire wound element
• Suffer less from the strain
• Allowing expansion
• These elements can only operate up to
660°C.
18
To go higher than 300 degrees, we need another type of construction.
This construction is a wire wound around a certain ceramic support (which
will work better than plastic-they melt).
We are almost rid of the strain gage effect because the wire can change in
the support, it is not attached.
It will not affect the temperature measurement. As such, they reach 660
degrees.
It is still not the 850 degrees. The reason is that we have a support at the
bottom where the platinum wire needs to be attached. Thus, we will get still
the effect.
18
Resistance Temperature Detector: Coiled elements
• Hard fired ceramic oxide tube
• Very finely ground ceramic powder in tube
to keep good thermal contact without stress
• These elements can operate up to 850°C.
19
The state of the art in platinum sensors PT100 are the coiled elements.
These sensors are way more expensive (20 euros).
The sensor is on the top.
Inside, the wire is freely floating in ceramic dust. Thus, it is not strained
anymore.
What changes here is that the sensor is connected by means of 4 wires.
The second part is just for support.

20
How does the relation look like.
On the left y axiswe have the temperature coefficient. It is positive, which
means that increases with the temperature. However, it is not linear, if it
were, it would be a flat line.
If we compare with a thermocouple this is a predictable behavior.
Moreover, even if it not a flat line, the relation is a straight line. A derivative of
a straight-line is a constant. This means, that not the first derivative but the
second derivative will be constant.
What kind of formula should be used if the second derivative is a constant?
It will be a second order equation, right? If we have y = a +bx + cx2, we do
the second derivative, y’’ = c.
Thus, we can incorporate the relationship between resistance and
temperature in a second order formula and we can quite simply program it.
20
Resistance Temperature Detector: Formulas
The Callendar-Van-Dusen equation provides us a more accurate estimation of the
resistance temperature relationship of a PT100
For positive temperatures:
𝑅 = 𝑅 1+ 𝐴𝑇 +𝐵𝑇(cid:2870) (0°𝐶 ≤ 𝑇 < 850 °𝐶)
(cid:3021) (cid:2868)
𝐴 = 3.9083𝑥10(cid:2879)(cid:2871)°𝐶(cid:2879)(cid:2869)
𝐵 = −5.775𝑥10(cid:2879)(cid:2875)°𝐶(cid:2879)(cid:2870)
For temperatures below zero:
𝑅 = 𝑅 1+𝐴𝑇 +𝐵𝑇(cid:2870) +𝐶𝑇(cid:2871) 𝑇 −100 −200°𝐶 < 𝑇 < 0°𝐶 ,
(cid:3021) (cid:2868)
𝐶 = −4.183𝑥10(cid:2879)(cid:2869)(cid:2870)°𝐶(cid:2879)(cid:2871)
21
In fact, the Callendar-Van-Dusenequation provides such an estimation which
is very accurate. For positive temperatures we actually havesomething like
this. This means that with a formula, I can clearly relate temperature and
resistance.
R0 is 100 Ohm, because it is a PT100.
As we can see the factor B is already very small, which means that if we do
not need extremely accurate measurement, we could consider it linear
Moreover, for temperatures bellow zero, we get a cubic relation. Again, C is
even smaller than B. Thusthey could be neglected.
21
Resistance Temperature Detector: Quality and tolerances
Class AA : ±( 0.10 + 0.0017 * | t | ) °C
Class A : ±( 0.15 + 0.0020 * | t | ) °C
Class B : ±( 0.30 + 0.0050 * | t | ) °C
Class C : ±( 0.60 + 0.0100 * | t | ) °C
Example:
Tolerance at 0°C for a Class AA is 0.1°C and for a Class C is 0.6°C
Tolerance at 200°C for a Class AA is 0.44°C and for a Class C is 2.6°C
22
We can buy the sensors in different qualities, which will also lead to different
tolerances. The lowest quality is the C class, where the best quality is the
AA.
For instance, if we buy a class AA, we will have at 0 degree Celsius a
maximum of 0.1 variation while the tolerance is 0.6 for the class C.
For a higher temperature, the tolerance will be 0.44 for class AA and of 2.6
for class C.
22
Resistance Temperature Detector: Self-heating
• Minimum current should be used for the required system resolution
• Largest RTD value chosen that results in acceptable response time
• Most of the PT100 are specified to be operated with a current of 1mA or less
• It will result in a small voltage drop (1𝑚𝐴𝑥100Ω = 100𝑚𝑉)
• Duty-cycling solution
23
How do we measure the resistance?
As this is an active sensor, we will need an excitation voltage, right?
However, as we want to measure the resistance value with an outside
source, we will need to put a certain current through the resistor (R=V/I).
This means we will have power that will be dissipated in our resistance.
Therefore, we will have a self-heating effect while measuring.
For this reason, we will need to limit the amount of current and voltage that
go through the resistor.
Most of the PT100 are specified to be operated with a current of 1mA or less,
which results on a drop of 100mV, but it will still heat up.
The only real way to limit the self-heating effect will be by means of duty-
cylingthe current. In it, we will input an excitation which will only provide a
high value of current for the measuring window. For instance, if the limit is
1mA, we could decide to use a 10% duty cycle which means that 10% of the
time we could provide 10mA and the rest 1mA and we would be fine.
23
Resistance Temperature Detector: Leads
55°error
24
One final problem arises from the fact that we will have wires leading to the
RTD, as it can be shown in the first figure. The wires will have their own
resistance. Thus, measuring the resistance through the wires means that we
will also get an influence of the wires’ resistance. This is then, a very bad
way to measure RTDs leading to errors close to 50 degrees.
A better way to measure will be to use the four-wire or Kelvin connection.
This is the reason we saw the four wires in the previous example
(professional PT100). We will use two wires to induce a current, this is a
constant current. Why a constant current source? Everywhere the current is
the same. On the other side, we will put the measuring system. There is no
current flowing on that side and therefore there is nearly no drop of voltage
(the resistance of the wires will not matter). Thus, we have the force leads
(to send the excitation)and the sense leads will be just to measure (no
current).

25
Thus, RTDs have also a very broad range, with a fairly linearbehavior.
Moreover, it is very lowcost.
However, it requires excitation which can lead to self heating.
25
Thermistors
(cid:2869) (cid:2869)
[(cid:2962) (cid:2879) ]
𝑅 = 𝑅 𝑥𝑒 (cid:3021) (cid:3021) (cid:3116)
(cid:2868)
26
This is the cheapest temperature sensor. You have used it in labs. A
thermistor is not a pure metal but a composition of material to make it
cheaper and more sensitive.
Here you can see the relationship between temperature and resistance
which is again not linear.
T0 is the temperature for which it is calibrated. It is usually set to 25 degrees
Celsius (room temperature).
R0 is the resistance at 25 degrees, for instance 10KOhm
Beta determines the sensitivity (go to next slide).
While these are non-linear, they are predictable and cheap, meaning that
they are broadly used for a plethora of applications.
If we know T0, R0 and T0, we will just need to calculate the output
temperature.
26
Thermistors: Beta
27
The value of beta we can see here, for instance. We can take the 10K Ohm
resistor at 25 degrees has a resistance of 10, with a value of beta of 3950. If
we check at 0 degrees it is 100 KOhm, which means this is an NTC system.
(Resistance decreases with the temperature)
27
Thermistors: Resistance vs Temperature
28
Indeed, this is a very non-linear relation where when the temperature rises,
the resistors drops. We will need calibration and computer calculations
28
Thermistors: Temperature coefficient
29
Moreover, the temperature coefficient is actually very high, much higher than
for the previous cases. This means it is very easy to implement.
29
Thermistors: Linearization
30
And actuallyit is possible to add a linearization resistor to linearize the
behavior.As such, we introduce the parallel combination of the two resistors
and we linearize the system. It becomes a bit easier to implement.
Thus, this NTC thermistor is very good for low accuracies but very cheap
systems or systems.

Thus, it is not linear (except for the linearization resistance) but it has very

Semiconductors Temperature Sensors: Intro
• Ebers Moll equation (relationship between diode current and diode voltage):
(cid:3023) (cid:3044)
(cid:3253)
𝐼 = 𝐼 𝑒 (cid:3038)(cid:3021)
(cid:3005) (cid:3046)
• In transistors we have a very similar relationship between 𝑉 and 𝐼 :
(cid:3029)(cid:3032) (cid:3030)
(cid:3023) (cid:3044)
(cid:3251)(cid:3254)

Where:
o
• 𝐼 : constant for a semiconductor type
(cid:3046)
• 𝑞: charge of an electron
• 𝑘: Boltzman constant
• 𝑇: absolute temperature
32
The last temperature sensor that we will discuss is the semiconductor
temperature sensor.
If you remember from the electronic course on the first year, for a diode we
can find a relationship between the current and the voltage that go through it.
The same relation exists between VbeandIc, where Is isconstant
depending on the semiconductor type, k is the boltzmanconstant, T the
absolute temperature and q the charge of an electron
This means the higher the Vbe, the higher the current Ic. Same at it
happened with the diodes.

(cid:3046) (cid:3046)
33
Now, if we change the relation to Vberespect to the current, we will have
something very interesting, which is that from the change of Temperature, we
get a voltage change right?
This means that we could use this transistor to measure temperature.
For that, we can use the following circuit. In it, we have instead of one
transistor we have N transistors, all connected in parallel. The formula can
just be transformed, where the factor N just appears in the denominator. The
current is just divided into all the stages.

Proportional to the absolute

34
Now, let’s substractthe voltage of one transistor to the voltage of N ones.
The output is something that is ONLY dependent on the absolute
temperature. In fact, it is proportional to the absolute temperature (ptat).

This can be nicely integrated into a chip. We can get this formula of Vptat,
you can do it on your own to see if you get to the solution. Againthe voltage
is proportional to the input temperature.
36
Semiconductor Temperature Sensors: AD592, TMP17
37
These are relatively expensive (10 euros). They are active sensors of
course. You can have a look at the characteristics here.
37
Semiconductor Temperature Sensors: TMP35-36-37
38
These are other examples. They are very good to measure outside
temperature. They are linear and very nice to use. Moreover, the supply
voltages are not that critical.

Now we have the four types. We can first see that the thermocouple is the
one that will have the broadest range by far.
Of course, it will not be the cheapest.
The thermocouple is the only one that is a passive sensor, no need for
excitation voltage
RTDs as compared to thermistors, they are both very cheap.
