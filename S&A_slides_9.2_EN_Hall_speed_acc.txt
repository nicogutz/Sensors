Hall effect magnetic sensors: Introduction

These sensors became quite cheap and have a lot of potential. They are still
not widespread usedbut they are rather new and booming. Moreoverthey
are very small.
How do hall effect magnetic sensors work?
A Hall sensor is a sensor which is sensitive to a magnetic field.
Is this the same as the inductive coil-based sensors?
Not really, in there we saw sensors for which the output voltage is sensitive
to the change of magnetic field (faraday‚Äôs law). If there is no movement or
change in the magnetic field, the inductor will not see a voltage.
Hall sensors can detect a magnetic field, even if there is no movement.
Thus, they can detect a magnetic field even when it is not change. For
instance, they can be used to detect the gravitational field around the earth.
Of course, in order tohave this magnetic field, we will need a current going
through the sensor. The current will generate the magnetic field (Ampere‚Äôs
law) and a voltage will be created.
Of course, this condition only happens in very specific materials. In fact, until
recently, this type of sensors could only be made out ofsome heavy metals
(such as gold and platinum). Now, there are actually semiconductorsthat
behave the same way.

Hall effect magnetic sensors: Definition
Since V is proportional to magnetic field and not to the rate of
H
change in magnetic field like an inductive sensor, the Hall Effect
provides a more reliable low speed sensor then an inductive
pickup.
5
Thus, and this is important: The Hall voltage is dependent and proportional
to the magnetic field and not on the change of the magnetic field. It can
generate voltage out of a DC magnetic field. So, it can provide very low
speed sensor for inductive pickup.

Currently, Hall sensors are very small integrated circuits that cost around 1
euro. They are also very easy to use.
On two of the legswe connect the excitation voltage (between 3 and 6 V)
and at the other two legs we can measure the output voltage.
Moreover, this is a linear sensor, the higher the magnetic field, the higher the
voltage.
Very simplistic then, you can install the sensor, you come with a magnetand
it will generate a voltage.
The displacement is not exactly in the hall sensor, but we induce it by means
of a magnet which is brought closer or further to the sensor to generate the
voltage. Thus, we can measure displacement.
6
Hall effect magnetic sensors: Application
7
Where can we use these hall sensors?
For instance, in industrial applications we can use them to detect the rotation
of a shaft contactlessly. On the shaft we place one or more magnets, and the
hall sensor close to the magnet. Each time the shaft turnsand the magnet
comes close to the hall sensor, a pulse will be detected.
How would we measure the rpms (rotation per minute)? We would put one
magnet and measure the period between pulses.
The hall sensor output would need to be amplified a little bit (as it is
millivolts), and a comparator with hysteresis is needed so that we can obtain
very nice pulses.
Is the hall sensor good for position detection?
Not really, it is very rough as we cannot really put infinite magnets on the
shaft, but it can actually detectthe displacement of the shaft.

We can actually dobetter!
Suppose we have a gear with teeth and valleys.
It needs to be a gear of a ferromagnetic material as it needs to be able to
generate a magnetic field. It would not work with plastic, aluminum or
ceramics but with steel or an iron gear.
Working principles:
‚Ä¢ We have a shaft and we put a gear on with a certain amount of tooth and
valleys.
‚Ä¢ We can put our hall sensor on top (the white block).
‚Ä¢ On top of the hall sensorwe attach a permanent magnet.
‚Ä¢ Now there is a tooth and a valley coming by. What will happen? As the
gear is made of steel or iron, it will conduct the magnetic field of the
permanent magnet.
8
Hall effect magnetic sensors: Single Gear position (2)
9
If we have a tooth coming by, the signal with be low, because we will lose the
flux within the gear (iron or steel).
On the other hand, if there is a valley coming by, the complete magnetic field
will be close around the hall sensor. Thus, it will be high.
In summary, we have a change of flux concentration in the sequence of teeth
and valleys.
In industrial applications, this will be nicely packaged, so that it could also be
put on the water. These could also be used on bikes or motorbikes to detect
movement.
Same as for optical encoders, we can count the number of teeth going
around, as to know the position and the speed of the gear.

However, as the permanent magnet constantly generates a magnetic field.
The value of the hall voltage on the teeth or the valleys, will only vary a little
bit. This can be seen in the first two lines. Therefore, counting the pulses
becomes very difficult and not easy to measure with standard systems.
Moreover, when we move the sensor slightly closer or further away from the
shaftwe will see that the floating line (the base line of voltage) will just float
up and down. This will make it virtually impossible to detect. We need
something that is more robust that can work whenever required.
The way to solve it is to create a differential hall sensor, where two hall
sensors are connected to one magnetand we get two outputs (fields 1 and
2). Now, we can substractthe two outputs and get the differential graph. This
signal will be easy to detect the difference between valley and tooth. It will be
much better for long term.
Why is this good? It does not matter the real position of the teeth. And we
can detect relatives.

11
Of course, this differential sensor will only be able to measure in one
direction (same as optical encoders) as if we turn the other way around, it
will be exactly the same.
To detect the direction, we need to have two differential hall sensors where
the second one will be located ¬º of a pitch later (as in optical encoders).
Then, we can do exactly the samething as we did with the optical encoders.
How many hall sensors would we need for this?
We could do this with 4 hall sensors connected to the same permanent
magnet. Alternatively, we could use 3 hall sensors in which we use the
output of the second 2 times.
11
Hall effect magnetic sensor: Angular Hall Bridge
12
As we were saying, nowadays hall sensor technology is getting very popular
and a lot of industrial applications have risen.
The example here is from the company Austriamicrosystemswhich
specializes in hall sensor technologies. We have 1 chip with four hall
sensors. We can put this chip in front of a shaft such as in the figure and on
the shaftwe put a permanent magnet.
As the four Hall sensors are in quadrature, what they see from the magnetic
field will change all the time. Thus, their differential outputs can be used to
be able to detect absolute positions of the shaft.
12
Hall effect magnetic sensor: Magnetic multipole
13
There are other type of applications, such as here, with a multipole
permanent magnet. Here the displacement can also be measured
longitudinally instead of rotation.

14
To conclude with the displacement sensors, we have one final system which
measures displacement by means of ultra sound.
‚Ä¢ It works around 40KHz.
‚Ä¢ It requires a transmitter/receiver on very high frequency.
‚Ä¢ A pulse on 40KHz is sent through the transmitter (like a burst of 40KHz on
a loudspeaker).
‚Ä¢ We wait until the pulse comes back.
‚Ä¢ The time difference will determine the distance.
This system has quite some drawback:
‚Ä¢ This system is not precissedat all. Why? We require to point in one
directionbut we depend on the speed of sound, which is 300m/s.
However, this speed is only at one specific temperatureand it will change
heavily with it. Moreover, it is humidity dependent and environment
parameters.
‚Ä¢ In addition, the attenuation is very strongand we can only properly
measure for a few meter
‚Ä¢ Finally, we are heavily dependent on the structure of the reflecting surface.
If this one is very absorbing, not much will come back.
In summary, these sensors are good if we want to have an approximate idea
of if something is close to usbut it is not a good idea as a measurement
system.

Velocity sensors
15
Introduction to Velocity sensors
Measuring range of velocity Bandwidth Type of sensor

Slow <1Hz Displacement
(eliminates fast accelerations) (mean velocity)
Medium <1KHz Velocity
Fast >1KHz Acceleration
(good for detection of fast accelerations)
16
We finished the displacement sensors. These are a key for a lot of
applications as often we will transduce other property into displacement and
this displacement will be measured by the sensor.
Now we can do velocity. This is very common on our daily life (in cars, etc.)
While we are very familiar with velocity, we do not pay so much attention on
how the sensors work.
The reason for this is that there are actually not many velocity sensors which
would indicate the instantaneous velocity. Most of the times, when we
measure velocitywe would work more on the average velocity. This is just
measured as the displacement divided by the time passed.
However, this measurement could be that is not correct. Imagine we want to
measure the average velocity between Brussels and Gent. We calculate the
displacement and divide it by the time spent. That should be correct, right?
But, if we do the same exercise, but we will go first to Brugge, we would
have more time spent, but the displacement would be the same (starting-
finishing point). This would not be correct.
Thus, depending on the type of movement, we will need to measure velocity
in a different manner.
We can define three categories:
‚Ä¢ If the change of the velocity is very veryslow (the acceleration is very
small). We can measure the displacement and divide it by time. This will
be a mean velocity. Differentiate displacement to measure velocity.
‚Ä¢ If the velocity is changing more during the measurement, the average will
be wrong. In that case, we can measure momentary velocity which is a bit
less obvious.
‚Ä¢ In the extreme case, the velocity changes very fast, then it is best to
16
measure acceleration and integrate acceleration to know velocity.
16
Slow velocity - Relative velocity by electrical differentiation of
displacement voltage signals
BUT:
‚Ä¢ The main problem is that differentiation accentuates any low-amplitude,
high-frequency noise present in the displacement signal.
‚Ä¢ Accurate time reference is necessary
‚Ä¢ No real time velocity information ‚ÄìMean velocity
17
For the first case, we will differentiate the response of any of the
displacement sensors we have seen so far.
But,there are several problems:
‚Ä¢ First, the differentiation will introduce noise. This means we might need to
filter it out.
‚Ä¢ Moreover, we will need very accurate time reference, which is not very
easy.
‚Ä¢ Finally, this is the mean velocity not instantaneous.
How could we measure instantaneous velocity? Velocity dedicated sensors
17

In order tohave a velocity sensor, we need to find a law of physics which
relates velocity with an electrical property. However, there are not a lot of
laws of physics that relate velocity, which could be used for a sensor.
There is actually one. Does anyone remember the second rule that we
defined for electro mechanicalconversion (generator rule)?
When we displace a wire in a magnetic field, we will generate a voltage into
the wire or how we said for motors, if we have a movement, we will have a
back-emf or voltage generated.
This was e = Blv, where v is actually thevelocity!
The faster we move the wire, the higher the voltage. These type of sensors
are called Tachometers.

‚Ä¢ Just like a DC motor working as a generator
‚Ä¢ The polarity changes if direction changes.
‚Ä¢ Typical output voltage: 7V/1000rpm on 5000rpm with an accuracy of 0,07%.
‚Ä¢ Special DC-generators are developed with high sensitivity : 500V/1000rpm to
30.000V/1000rpm
19
What is a Tachometer? It is a motor!
In its simplest form, we could take a DC motor, which can be reversed as a
generator. The faster we turn, the higher the generated voltage.
We have a direct angular velocity (rotation) sensor which provides an
immediate measurement of the speed. The voltage coming out will be linear
with the angular velocity.
DC tachometers can generate voltages at a very low rotation speed.

‚Ä¢ AC motor in generator mode
‚Ä¢ One phase is excited with AC
‚Ä¢ At the second phase an AC voltage is generated with the same frequency.
‚Ä¢ The amplitude is 0V when no movement and is proportional to the angle
velocity.
‚Ä¢ Phase sensitive demodulation is required to detect direction.
‚Ä¢ Frequency response is limited to 1/10 tot 1/5 of the from the excitation
frequency
20
There are also AC Tachometers or alternators (which is the opposite of an
AC motor).
In this case, if it turns, an AC voltage is generatedand the amplitude of the
voltage is proportional to the speed. If we turn the other way around, the
voltage we will be opposite polarity.
AC tachometers can be a bit less expensive, as we do not need
commutation. However, the detection is a bit more complicated.
This is the ONLY way to measure instantaneous velocity. If we, however,
have a very strong acceleration, it might be that this system is not fast
enough for this. Do you remember the inertia that makes the system not to
change speed very fast?
For very fast acceleration, the inertia can be a problem. If the bandwidth is
more than one 1KHz, we will need to use acceleration.
20
Variable reluctance speed sensor
‚Ä¢ When a target feature (such as a gear tooth) is moved close to the sensor, the flux is at a maximum.
‚Ä¢ The moving target results in a time-varying flux that induces a proportional voltage in the coil.
‚Ä¢ Pro:
‚Ä¢ No excitation (passive sensor)
‚Ä¢ Low cost (except electronics)
‚Ä¢ Use at high temperatures (up till 300¬∞C)
‚Ä¢ Very robust
‚Ä¢ Con:
‚Ä¢ Not for low speed
‚Ä¢ Sub sequentially not for position sensing
21
This is a very special case of movement sensor, but as it detects velocity, we
add it here.
This is the variable reluctance speed sensor. Often used in automotive
technology.
We have a coil and a magnet core.
If the magnet is fixed, we will not generate any voltage on that coil, right?
Now, we could move the magnet inside the coil, and there will be generated
a voltage that will be depending on the speed of movement of the core within
the coil. This changes the fluxand the change of flux generates a voltage. If
we move a metal bar (target) in front of that magnet, the flux will actually
change.
We will need a movement of that gear or target into the sensor.
Very robust, and can have very high temperatures with very simple
electronics output
It is passive! It generates its on voltage. We will need a minimum speed in
order togenerate the voltage or we will not be able to generate anything. It is
not possible to use as a position sensor
21
Average relative velocity measurement example

22
We can also find velocity sensors in a place like the wheel of a motorbike. In
it, we will have an ABS, that allows for the wheel not to block for very sudden
stops. If the speed is zero, it will release the wheel. If it does not generate
pulses, the wheel is not moving anymore.
22
Gyroscopes ‚Äì Absolute Angular Rate sensors
‚Ä¢ Absolute Angular Rate Sensors

digital cameras
23
Finally, we have the gyroscope. It measures the pitch, yaw and roll of a
plane.
However, it is not measuring the angle, it is measuring the angular speed.
We will discuss further next week with the MEMs technology, but the most
important thing is that this is not a displacement, but a speed sensor.
23
Acceleration sensors
We just said that for velocity we have an issue that we could not really
measure instantaneous velocity but rather average one by means of
displacement.
Acceleration sensors encounter also an issue.
It is not that easy to measure it because of the influence of the gravity force
(or acceleration). So, any accelerometer that we can build it will always
measure the gravity force or acceleration, where we actually wantto
measure is the relative acceleration of a device.
We will then need to differentiate between absolute acceleration and relative
acceleration sensors.
24
Relative Acceleration
‚Ä¢ Gravity force => gravity acceleration????
‚Ä¢ Possibilities for relative-acceleration measurement include graphical or electrical
differentiation of displacement or velocity signals.
‚Ä¢ The double differentiation required of displacement records or voltages can
rarely be performed accurately except with very smooth signals.
‚Ä¢ Single differentiation of velocity signals may be practical in some instances.
25
Let‚Äôs start with the relative acceleration.
Is it actually easyto measure relative acceleration? Actually, notat all, as we
always get the influence of the gravity.
Are there possibilities to measure only gravity acceleration? Actually, there
exist no accelerometer only measuring gravity or relative acceleration.
But,we can calculate it offline by means of knowing the second differential of
displacement. However, as we said in velocitywe have problems on
understanding the exact timing and the noise.
If we have a tachometers, we can differentiate ones, which simplifies.
There are of course some tricks we can actually takeas we know the gravity
force.
We know that the gravity force is actually aDC component. Thus, if we have
an absolute accelerometer that measures everything, we could remove the
DC component and analysethe AC component, which will be the relative
acceleration.
Of course, this means that the relative acceleration needs to be dynamic, if
we have an acceleration which is constant, it will be very difficult to
distinguish from the gravitational force.
Alternatively, if we want to get the value of the relative acceleration on a
perpendicular direction to the gravity force, it can be eliminated.
If an accelerometer moves horizontally, the gravity will not have any effect. If
the sensor is only sensitive on the perpendicular directions, the influence can
be removed.
However, we will need to measure absolutes.
25
Seismic- (Absolute-) Acceleration Accelerometers: Applications
The most important pickup for
vibration, shock, and general-
purpose absolute motion
measurement is the
accelerometer.
26
The first accelerometer that we are going to discuss is the seismic absolute
accelerometer. It measures absolute acceleration.
Where is it used? It is used in shock (airbag systems-very strong
deceleration), or in vibration technology. Vibration always generates
accelerations and decelerations.

27
All accelerometers work with the same principles.
A mass-spring system (which we saw last year).
How does it work?
‚Ä¢ We need a seismic mass
‚Ä¢ We subject it to an acceleration a
‚Ä¢ Due to the acceleration, a Force Fa appears on the mass, opposite to the
acceleration which will be related to the acceleration
‚Ä¢ What is then the value of a? a will be Fa/M
‚Ä¢ This will provoke for the spring to shrink and to create an opposite force
Fxtowards the mass. This force will be the spring constant times the
displacement
‚Ä¢ As the forces are the same and oppositewe can see that aM= kxor x =a
M/k
This means that we transduce the acceleration into a displacement, and we
will just need a displacement sensor to measure it.
This is the reason why a lot of the accelerometers take the name from their
displacement counterpart.

Now, of course, if we use a spring as we have seen already many times, we
actually havea second order system. Thus, there could be some instability,
that is the reason why we need a damper.

29
These are the main types of accelerometers. As we can see, they are based
on their displacement counter parts.
For instance, how would an unbounded strain-gage accelerometer work?
We would have the SG connected to a mass. There is some acceleration,
and the mass reacts with an opposite force, the displacement changes and
the resistance changes as well.
Let‚Äôs discuss a couple of other cases.

30
Here we can see the case of the bounded strain-gage accelerometer. How
does this work?
We have the gaging elements (sg resistors) on top and bottom of both sides
and mounted on top of what we could call springs.
When there is an acceleration, the mass in the middle will get a force and
due to that, the SG will be elongated or shrunk. Top ones are elongating,
bottom ones are shrinking.
It is only sensitive in that direction (parallel to the gravity).
One important note is that this is a seismic accelerometer. This means that
even if there is no movement, it will measure the gravitational acceleration,
as the mass will be pushed by the gravity.
If we turn it over it will just measure the gravity negative.

This one is an accelerometer built on a differential capacitor (from last
session).
Let‚Äôs try to see if we can identify all the elements. If you remember from a
differential capacitorwe had two conductor plates and a membrane in the
middle.
The two plates (electrodes) are the conducting plates
The membrane will be the seismic element
Now for the accelerometer, we need to identify some extra elements:
‚Ä¢ Mass
‚Ä¢ Spring
‚Ä¢ And maybe the dampers.
These can be found on the middle piece or seismic element:
‚Ä¢ The mass would be the middle of the disk.
‚Ä¢ The springs are connected to the mass. These are the open lines that will
allow for the mass to go up and down.
‚Ä¢ The dampers would be the wholes
How would this work? As we get an acceleration on the system, the mass
reacts with a Force, the springs help move the membrane (seismic element)
and the capacitors value change due to the displacement.

This is a very special accelerometer.
If you remember from Wednesday, a piezoelectric material was a crystal
quartz that was generating charges.
It can only generate the current as long aswe have a frequency. As long as
there is a frequencywe are finebut it will not be able to detect a DC
acceleration!
The middle is the mass, connected to the springs s, and the P piezoelectric
material. When we have an acceleration, the mass will be pushed down, on
the piezoelectric material and will generate a voltage, which can be detected
outside.
Suppose we have a DC acceleration. We have a constant force, constant
displacement, so it would not generate a voltage anymore. So, it is not
suitable.
Perhaps we could think that as it does not measure DC acceleration (not
sensitive to DC acceleration), it could be a good example for detecting
relative acceleration.
But it is not true, it eliminates not only the gravitational accelerationbut it will
also eliminate any kind of DC acceleration. Any constant acceleration will not
change the thickness. It can only measure dynamic changes of acceleration.
It eliminates a bit TOO much.
Why is this useful? It would be useful for vibrations which will have
acceleration and deceleration. It is The chosen sensor for this.

We can have different types of configurations. We have analyzed the
simplest case (a). What are the disadvantages of the first config? It will only
measure acceleration in one directionbut it can actually movein every
direction, this could cause some noise.
B on the other hand, has a pin going through the mass so it can only move in
one direction.
The third one is very similar
The fourth one is actually aninteresting case of shear movement.
In All cases we will have a pre-force on the mass, so that it cannot move on
the crystal.
You should be able to interpret this graph as we discussed on the last
session.

We remember the problem regarding the amplification of piezoelectric
materials, where we had to increase the impedance and adding the shunt
capacitor.
However, making the input impedance very high has a problem.
Increasing impedance decreases the current (which it would be our purpose
as it allows to increase the measurement). However, this could make the
sensor more vulnerable to external magnetic and electrostatic fields. This will
cause noise which will interfere with the signal as the signal will very small
(in picoamp).
Thus, the close you put it to the sensor, or in the sensor the amplifier the
better.
Here, we can see the amplifier inside the sensor. This technology is called
Iepeaccelerometer. It will already change the charge into amplified current.
Of course, the issue comes with the following. My piezoelectric sensor was
passive, if you remember, where we do not need a power supply for it.
However, now we have an amplifier inside which will require power on its
own.
Would we need three cables entering the sensor (DC, signal and ground)?
Actually not, as my piezoelectric only measures AC, it is possible to transport
on the same cable both the DC supply for the amplifier and the signal. Then,
we just need a capacitor which will make sure only the AC signal gets
measured.

‚Ä¢ What is the mounted frequency for piezoelectric accelerometers
35
There are different manners to put this sensor on the surface of a machine.
The manner in whichis connected will unfortunately affect the resonance
frequency.
The simplest manner is a magnetic connection. However, there will be an air
gap between magnet and sensor, it will not be able to detect very high
frequency.
It is also possible to add an adhesive, for instance wax, it can eliminate the
air gap and increase the resonance.
The other two are for definitive mounting,
Quickfitand the stud requires drilling.
The most permanent the solution, the higher the resonance frequency.

This is the last accelerometer. This is the next step in electronics. This tries
to make the whole accelerometer and inside a chip. This means we need to
use a very small sensor and very small variation.
A chip where a mass is moving is not very easy. This will need to be done by
means of MEMs that we will see next week.
We can see the mass, now the spring is actually a coil as you can see with a
core inside.
Now if we put a current into a coil by F=Bli, we get a Force. The higher the
current, the more force I put on the core.
