So farwe have had resistive and inductive displacement sensors. Today we
are going to discuss capacitive displacement sensors. In them, we can again
modify some of the components and get a change in the capacitance.
We see in the equation that capacitors are proportional to the area, to the
electrical permittivity or dialectricconstant and inversely proportional to the
distance between the two plates.
We could again play with those three parameters to understand
displacement. In practice, the most simplistic manner of changing the value
of the capacitance will be by changing the distance between the two plates.

Here we can see a very simple example, where Cxis the capacitor that we
will use to measure the displacement. This circuit actually shows the way in
which capacitor microphones work.
Sounds are pressure waves. These are travelling at the speed of sound on
top of the pressure around us. At the other side there needs to be a receptor,
which will be a membrane. It would be the ear (ear drum) for instance but in
this case is the microphone. So, if we talk into the microphone, the
membrane of the microphone will vibrate at the same rate and the same
amplitude as the one that we are producing with the voice. So, we need a
kind of membrane. We can take a capacitor: a fixed plate and a kind of a
conducting membrane and we can measure the capacitor in front of that
membrane. If I can detect the value of that capacitor, I will be able to have a
certain displacement sensor.
Here in the figure, we see something along those lines. We have the
capacitor (Cx) with the moving plate (the front one) and the fixed one. Now,
we will be able to measure the capacitance Cx.
In order to do that, we will need an AC excitation voltage, an input capacitor
Ci, and the Operational amplifier. In the feedback we can put out
displacement sensor.
Now, we can check the equations. As we are dealing with AC components,
we analysethe circuit in the frequency domain.
First, what is the output input relationship here? It is the output impedance
divided by the input one. Do not forget the negative sign (–) because we are
using the inverted OA input.
If we make some calculations, we get to this formula, where the amplitude of
5
the sinusoidal output wave will be a constant K, multiplied by the
displacement x. Thus, it will be proportional to the displacement of my
capacitor.
This is a very simple set up, not very commonly used but it gives
already an idea on how the proportionality works.
Moreover, there is an issue with it. Imagine, there is some moist, some
dust, or some changing temperature between the plates. These could
heavily influence the value of the capacitor, when what we actually
wanted to know was the displacement of the membrane. As we
measure absolute values, this system is very environmentally
dependent. It would be best if we were able to use relative values. This
is exactly what we do in the next example.

6
This is a more interesting example. Why?
Because this is all about relative measurements which are much easier and
more accurate to measure. In the same sensor, we have a double capacitor
(C1 and C2). The membrane will be in between the two plates that will move
up and down. Without displacement we have d distance which is the middle
between the two plates (where the membrane is to start with) and x will be
the displacement that occurs between the standard position and the current
location.
Thus, when x changes, both the values of C1 and C2 will also change. We
can calculate C1-C2 divided by C1+C2. What is this? It is the relative change
of our capacitor. Moreover, x/d is the relative movement of our membrane.
What would happen if the temperature changes for instance? Will the
measurement be affected? Both capacitors will be affected, so the relative
relation will not change. Of course, we will need to measure that differential
capacitor. How could we do this?

We will need to use a wheastonebridge. How does this work?
We will put the two variable capacitors C1 and C2 and two dummy
capacitors C3, and C4 of the same value. In case that C1 and C2 are not the
same, we could use an extra variable capacitor C3 to balance them out so
that when the beginning of the measurement starts, we have the same
value. Now we can do exactly what we did for the resistors but now it will be
with capacitors. Thus, we will work with impedances. The impedance of a
capacitor is 1/jwC. The excitation voltage is of course an AC (we need a
certain frequency).
If we do the calculations and make sure than C3 and C4 are the same, we
get to this thing that we saw in the previous slide C1-C2/C1+C2, we can
replace it by x/d. This means that we have a very nice and very linear
relation between excitation voltage and output voltage, where the sensitivity
is dependent on the excitation voltage, and the distance between the plates
and it is proportional.
Watch out again that these are AC voltages, this means that what we have
here is a relation between the amplitudes. If x increases the amplitude of the
output will increase.
Now, what happens if x is negative? The relation will be the same, but the
sign will be minus. What does this mean? That my input and output will not
be in phase but in counterphase.
What does this mean for the measuring system? We will need a
synchronous detector (like in the previous lecture with inductive sensors)
where we can input the excitation voltage and compare the phases. If the
sinusoids are in phase, we know that the displacement is positive. If they are
in counter phase, we will know it is negative.

What are the properties of these differential capacitors. If we compare them
to the inductive sensors of last week, we can see that they are comparable
with the LVDTs.
One first difference is that this one have a very light mass, while in the other
one we had to change the core that goes through the three coils. Here we
only need to change the membrane. It is perhaps a little bit less robust and
more vulnerable to vibration.
It has a very broad frequency spectrum (it depends on the membrane).
It is linear, and with a small hysteresis.
It can measure both static and dynamic movements, which is a big
advantage. Some of the next sensors, can only measure dynamic
movements.
We have temperature sensitivity but way less with the differential capacitor
as the change will be relative.
However:
It requires AC excitation, electronic processing (for the detection, for
instance) and it has high output impedance. This means it is quite sensitive
to noise. It will be best to put the amplifier very close to the sensor. In a lot of
cases the amplifier will already be implemented in the sensor.
8
Variable differential capacitor sensor: Example
9
These differential capacitors can be very verysmall. For instance, in this
case we can have dimensions in the micro meter order, where the
membrane is in the middle and the two ends create the capacitors.
9
Monopolar capacitive sensor
Changing the permittivity…
10
So, we have changed already the distance between the plates. Alternatively,
we could change the permittivity. We could use another dielectricalmaterial
while changing the permittivity. How would this work?
We have one plate of the capacitor (the internal) and we have the other plate
(external). In between we will have a shield. As such, the electric field is
forced to go around it not in between (as there is the shield). Thus, if there is
an object (something else than air) the epsilon r will be change, so will my
electric field. This can be calibrated of course to understand the degree in
which it is disturbed. There could be for instance probes, which could be
used to measure distance. Another example is a parking detector use to
measure the distance to the wall.

11
This is one final example. In this case actually what changes is the area
because we will have moving plates. In order to calculate these, we will need
to again put them in a full bridge and calculate. You can try to solve this at
home. For the first Capacitor (between k and p) we would have this formula,
where the area is b times (L/2 +x) which the area seen. If we do the same for
all four capacitors we arrive to the solution that V0 is equal to Vi times 2x/L.
Again very nice and depending on the varying length. With these we finish
the capacitive sensors and we move one to the piezoelectric ones.
11
Piezoelectric sensors
12
Piezoelectric sensor = charge generator
13
What are piezoelectric sensors? They will take advantage of the
The piezoelectric effect is the generation
piezoelectric effect (
of electric charge by a crystalline material upon
subjecting it to stress. The effect exists in natural
crystals, such as quartz (chemical formula SiO2), and
poled (artificially polarized) man-made ceramics and
some polymers).
First of all, a piezoelectric sensor is a charge generator.
It does not produce voltages or currents but charges.
This is of course an electrical output as well, which we
will transform in current or voltage, but the output is
charges.
Can any material work as piezoelectric? No, this is
related to materials in nature such as quartz, but
actually there are also some synthetic materials to do
this.
13
Here there is this example, a plate which is of
course completely isolated.
13
Piezoelectric sensor
• Charge generator
• Different modes exist to mechanical deforming the piezoelectric material:
Thickness changes
o
Expansion
o
Transversal shear
o
• Typical values for k are 2,3 pC/N for quartz and 140 pC/N for barium titanate.
NOTE: Sensitivity is in pC/N instead of pC/m (displacement sensor)
BUT:
• Manufacturers consider deformation as a consequence of force
• Force and displacement are proportional
14
What happens?
When we push on the material (we put force on it) and due to the elasticity
there will be a change (linear) with the force. That displacement will cause a
certain charge generation (e.g., if we bend it there would be positive charges
at the top and negative at the bottom). Only charges!
What can we do with these charges?
From the moment that we want to measure it, there will be a current. We
cannot measure anything without a current. However, in the moment that we
have a current, we will lose these charges. This means that we will need to
keep bending the material (up and down) to keep generating charges and we
will need a way to store those chargers (such as with a capacitor).
14
Piezoelectric sensors - Example
For a piezoelectric sensor of 1𝑐𝑚(cid:2870) area and 1𝑚𝑚 thickness with an applied force
due to a 10-g weight.
The generated voltage e is 0.23mV for the quartz and 14mV for barium titanite
crystals – Voltages are relatively large!
15
Here we can get an idea about what type of voltages can be derived from the
charges.
If we actually have a piezoelectric sensor of 1cm2 and a thickness of 1 mm.
We can calculate the capacitor if we know the sensitivity. If we put 10gr of
weight on that capacitor/crystal, we can actually generate 230 microvolt for
quartz and 14mv for a synthetic material. Just with 10 gr. This is not a
negligible voltage and could be easily amplified.
The problem of course is that it cannot be measured, because in the moment
it is measured, it is gone.

where:
𝐾 =𝐾⁄𝐶:𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝑉⁄𝑚)
(cid:3046)
16
So, we have this nice material where when we put some pressure on, in
generates a voltage, but we cannot really measure it. What do we do?
Let’s take a crystal and connect it to an oscilloscope with a coax cable and
we can just observe in the screen of the oscilloscope what happens. Will this
be a good setup?
Let’s try to make the equivalent circuit of the total system.
• We will have the charge generator, which means that we will have charges
appearing from displacement multiplied by a constant k or sensitivity
(linear with the displacement).
• We will in addition have the resistor Rs of the substractof the quartz
crystal.
• We will also have the capacitor of the crystal.
• We will have the capacitor of the cable, if we put a cable, we have a
capacitor.
• We will also have them the input capacitor of the amplifier (an oscilloscope
in this case)
• And the input impedance of the oscilloscope.
Now, will we see the change of charges in my oscilloscope? For it, we will
need to set up a current.
A current is the derivative of the charges in time, right, so the derivative of
the displacement multiplied by K. This is already something that provides us
with a bit of information. In order to see the change, and to actually have a
current, we need not that the displacement just happens once and stays in
its place, but I need that the charges keep on changing (that there is
movement up and down). We cannot keep the current if x is a constant.
16
If we assume that there is no current going through the amplifier, the
current will be equal to the current going through the resistors and the
current going through the capacitors. Now, we could calculate the
current that goes through the capacitor. And we know that the Vcor Vo
is the integral of the current.
This is a differential equation that we can solve in the frequency domain
and we get this transfer function.
What do we see?
First of all, we need for the movement to have a frequency (omega). If
we do not have a frequency, we have a 0 voltage.
Second of all, this is a filter, high pass filter, meaning that when we go to
higher frequencies, we will have a linear relation of Ks. Actually this
starts from the cut-off frequency.
16
Piezoelectric sensors: Behavior
𝐾
(cid:3046)

𝑓 =
(cid:2868) 2π𝑅𝐶
17
Here we can see the relationship, for very low frequencies or 0, the system
has a 0 response as we go over the cutoff frequency, we have a high pass
filter with a Ks response, where Ks is the sensitivity of the capacitors
together relative to the over all sensitivity (Ks = K/C). Then, we will have a
linear region.
Of course, this is a mechanical system so it can go into oscillation
(resonance) and this is also an unusable region. In summary, we will have a
usable region beyond my cut off frequency and below my resonance.
17
Piezoelectric sensors: Cut-off frequency vs Sensitivity
A piezoelectric sensor with an internal capacity of 400𝑝𝐹 and a
cable+amplifiercapacitance of 100𝑝𝐹 is connected to an amplifier
with input resistance of 1𝑀Ω.

The sensitivity will drop by 20% and the high pass frequency will
be 320Hz

a shunt of 500𝑝𝐹

The cut-off frequency will drop to 0,3𝐻𝑧 and the sensitivity
will decrease by 60%
Special “load amplifiers” will solve these problems
18
Let’s do a calculation. We have this example and we calculate the cut-off
frequency. Is this good? Well, 320Hz means that we have to move this
crystal 320 times per second for a linear relation. That’s not very easy to do,
right? We will want something is easy to manipulate.
The sensitivity is about 20% which is ok. But the cut off frequency is very
high.
How could we solve this?
Instead of a simple oscilloscope, we could use a buffer amplifier that has a
higher input impedance (500 MOhm). Moreover, we could add another
capacitor. The sensitivity will indeed decrease, but by adding the capacitor
the dynamic properties might increase. If we do the calculation, the cut off
frequency is now 0.3 Hz. It works even under one cycle per second which is
pretty nice. However, the sensitivity drops by 60%. We only have 1
mV/micrometer. This sensitivity is enough for most of the applications.
We can build special load amplifiers to solve these issues.

Piezoelectric sensors: Remarks & Properties
• No static displacement → Vibration detector
• When ω𝑅𝐶 ≫ 1: linear relationship between displacement and gen. voltage
• C and R amplifier need to be very big
• Properties:
o Pro:
• Good for medium to high frequencies
• Relatively big output voltage
• No excitation voltage (passive sensor)
o Con:
• Temperature sensitive
• No static measurements
• High impedance output
• Difficult amplification
19
As we have seen, it is not possible to use this as a static displacement
sensor. It is actually used very often as a vibration sensor.
And as we saw, we need a high input resistance and capacity to actually
have something useful.
It is good for:
Medium to high frequencies
Relatively big output voltage
No excitation voltage
Against:
Temperature sensitive,
No static measurements,
High impedance
And difficult amplification

Optical encoders
20
Optical encoders
21
This sensor is very much off-the-shelf. It is used in most labs and research
centers. It measures displacement by means of rotation.
We have a light source and a detector. In the middle, we will have an optical
disk with a shaft and small holes (at a certain period-pitch) that will rotate.
When it rotates, it will let the light through those wholes at a certain speed.
Thus, it can detect the displacement of the disk.
In summary, it is an incremental displacement sensor.
21
Optical encoders (2)
Incremental optical encoder
COUNTER
22
Here we can see the front view. If the disk moves, we get a pulse train at the
other end. We can count these pulses. We need a counter on the other side
to detect these pulses. We can have for instance 360 slots in the disk, so a
resolution of 1 degree. If we measure 30 pulses we know we had a
displacement of 30 degrees. This is incremental because we do not know
the exact position. We only know where the pulse is as we will see in the
next slide.
22
Optical encoders (3)
• Output signal of a single optical encoder
• Properties:
Resolution from 100 to 65000 with an absolute precision of 30 angle/ seconds
o
No direction information
o
Second light added for direction information (reset to 0 or initial position)
o
23
These can be very low resolution or very high resolution but they do not
provide any information of the location, only about the rotation. We cannot
even know if we are turning left or right as we do not have a reference
position.
These set ups are called A setups because we only have one row of pulses.
Most of these encoders actually will have at least two lights, such as shown
in the previous slide. We could have the A counter we saw, and then a Z
counter that allows for providing an absolute value. If the detector sees the Z
light, it means that it can reset the counter to 0 and start again. Then we get
at least an absolute position within the disk. This of course, will only work if
the wheel only turns one way.
23
Optical encoders (4)
For direction information:
• a second light source is placed on 1/4 of the distance of the former (quadrature)
• 3th one to detect a total revolution.
A
B
Z
24
What about if we would want to count both up and down? We could have a
third set of pulses (three light sources and detectors). In this case we will
have the A, B and Z. A and B are shifted 1/4thof a pitch (the period of the
pulses coming out), in quadrature. In this case I can detect the direction.
24
Optical encoders: Detection Modes
• Modes 1, 2 and 4……
H L H L H L L H L H
L H L H L H H L H L H
+ + + - - - Mode 1
+ + + + + + - - - - - Mode 2
+ + + + + + + + + + + + - - - - - - - - - - Mode 4
25
Optical encoders allow for different optical modes for detection by the
computer. Imagine this situation in which we have A and B for data and Z for
the direction
Mode 1 would work as follows (red):
If we are counting clock wise-We see a rising edge in A and B is low, we
count up(increment)
Now, if we are counting counter clockwise–We see a rising edge in A and B
is high, we count down (decrement)
Most of the researchers only use this mode. We have an encoder of 360
slots, meaning a resolution of 1 degree.
We could use the encoder in a more intelligent manner.
Suppose we can take another algorithm (in software) to increment the
resolution. How could we do this?
Mode 2 (green):
If we go clockwise –We see a rising edge in A and B is lowwe count up(just
as before). Moreover, if we see a falling edge in A and B is high, we will also
count up. This means that we can actually counttwice. Instead of 360, 720 in
our example.
Counterclockwise –We see the rising edge in A and B is high, we count low
(just as before). Moreover, if we see a falling edge in A and B is low.
Thus, for the same sensor we double the precision or half the resolution. We
coult720 with 360 holes.
We can even go to mode 4. In it we can take advantage of the four edges
(combining A and B):
Clockwise, we count upif:
• A is rising and B is Low.
25
• A is High and B is rising.
• A is falling and B is High.
• A is Low and B is falling.
Counter-clockwise, we count down if:
• A is rising and B is High.
• A is High and B is falling.
• A is falling and B is Low.
• A is Low and B is rising.
In this way we have ¼ of the resolution but 4 times the precision.
25
Optical encoders: Modes
• Modes 1, 2 and 4……
• Properties
• External counters needed to detect the absolute position.
• False detection when:
• 1.Interuption of the power supply.
• 2.Interference pulse induced
• 3.Contaminated disc
26
These are very promising! What are the properties?
First of all we need counters to detect the absolute position.
Suppose we have an interruption of the power supply, we need to restart the
system or it will not be possible to know the exact position.
Moreover, it is prone to interferences we could have an error until we have
the reset. We could also have a contaminated disk, this means we will need
to protect them from dusts.
Finally, if there is any vibration in the system, it could provoke again a
problem and false counter.
Thus, these are issues for incremental counters. There are some solutions.
26
Optical encoders: Absolute optical encoder
10 light sources
Absolute coding
10 light detectors
Decoding electronics
Properties:
• Pro:
• High precision up to 16 bits (more sensitive to
vibration)
• Less sensitive to noise and contamination
• Gray code
• Not to expensive
• Con:
• Temperature sensitive
• Shock sensitive
• Paying under 10 bits
27
These are the absolute encoder. Each position has a unique code. We have
10 different traces, where each of them represents a number which is
unique.
If we start the system, the position is known. Even vibration can be
controlled.
This is of course very nice but it will be limited in resolution. There are
limitations in terms of precision
It is expensive.
The code is not binary as you can see in the figure, it actually works with
gray code. Why is this? Because we do not want two outputs to change at
the same time.
They can be very high precision (16 bits) but those will be very expensive
(better to use a resolver),
Less sensitive for noise and contamination
It is of course shock sensitive. System vibrating between two numbers.
