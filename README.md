# ChatGPT Sensors Summary
Extracted all the text from the lecture PDFs and made a summary as well as questions by feeding it to GPT-4o-mini. It will have innacuracies but since the course has zero study material this is the best I could come up with for the time being. 
If you find an innacuracy please make a pull request, thanks!

The GPT code is in the summary.py file, the token is invalid so use your own.
The text extraction is text2.py
