Pressure sensors
After force sensors, we go to pressure. What is the relation between both?
Pressure is force on a certain surface (F/A in N/m2).

Introduction to pressure sensors: Types
1. Absolute pressure 𝑃 = 0 𝑃𝑎
(cid:2868)
2. Gage pressure 𝑃 = 101.325 𝑃𝑎
(cid:2868)
3. Differential pressure 𝑃 −𝑃
(cid:2869) (cid:2870)
4
There are different manners to measure pressure:
• We can first use the absolute pressure. We can measure the pressure
above the 0 Pa pressure (the vacuum pressure). This is a theoretic
system, because we cannot really measure the 0 Pa in a system.
• The gage pressure is used much more. In it, we open the end of the
reference pressure as shown in the figure. It will measure atmospheric
pressure (the surroundings) and in the other input we can put the pressure
that needs to be measured. Thus, we measure the pressure above the
environment pressure.
• In sensor technology, we will mostly use the third type, the differential
pressure measurement. We can access both sides of the membrane to
provide the measurement. Then, we can measure relative pressure.

Introduction to pressure sensors: Measuring Principles
5
There are different ways to measure pressure but they will have in common
that they will need an electrical output.
In most of the cases, we will put certain pressure and it will provoke a
displacement, which can be measured with a displacement sensor.
For instance, if we look at a, we have an input pressure that will cause a
motion to the membrane. This displacement could be measured with the
standard displacement sensors we have already discussed. Will it be a linear
relation? We do not know.
In the second one, b, we see a pressure input into a membrane that has two
domes (like for a loudspeaker). The pressure will provoke a displacement.
The membrane will be deformed.
An interesting example is shown in f (a c pressure sensor), where putting
pressure at the input will provoke the c to slightly open.
Finally in h, we have a spiral situation, in which with the pressure the spring
will open a bit and provoke a rotational displacement sensors.
These are manners to transduce pressure into displacement.
Let’s dig into some types of sensors.
5
Piezo electric pressure sensor
P
6
This is one of the most simplistic sensors to measure pressure. We put a
pressure on the top side, and we have a crystal. If you remember, this crystal
(piezoelectric) material will not work with DC pressure but only with AC (e.g.,
vibration).
One example of application of this sensor is an electronic stethoscope, which
is a crystal microphone. It will measure varying pressure or vibration (the
heart rate). Sound is always a pressure variation, which is very good for this
case.
How would it work, you put the sensor on the heart or the carotid, it can
measure two things: the total pressure and the movement of the skin (on the
lower frequencies (below 10 Hz)), even on the heart. If in an APEX, we
cancel the sound frequencies, we can see the waveform of the beating of the
heart. Moreover, if we cancel these ones, and we only focus on the higher
frequencies, we could even listen to the murmourof the blood stream
through the heart.
Thus, this sensor is not really providing a measurement, but rather a source
of listening so that the doctor can provide a subjective diagnosis of the heart.
6
Capacitive pressure sensor (1)
1 capacitor = Absolute measurement 2 capacitor = Differential measurement
7
We are interested to provide a value of the absolute measurement of the
pressure. This is what the capacitive pressure sensor does.
We have the membrane, in which we put some pressure, the capacitor will
change in value. Of course, this is just one capacitor, and as we have
already seen in multiple occasions, absolute measurements are prone to
errors, dust, humidity, making the measurement wrong.
This is what we see in the second figure, in it we see the two membranes at
both sides, that can be put under pressure, and the membrane in the middle
that can be moved, making a differential capacitor for displacement
measurement, such as the one we already discussed. How could we
measure against atmospheric pressure? We could just leave open one side.
7
Capacitive pressure sensor (2)
8
Here we see a small animation of how it works with one capacitor. These can
be integrated in integrated circuits, such as we will see later in this session. If
the pressure changes the capacity changes.

Capacitive pressure sensor (3)
9
And here we see how it would be shown both for the single capacitor case
as well as for the differential.

We can also create a pressure sensor with strain gages.
Imaging we have a membrane and we fix it to a ring. Then, if we put
pressure on it, it will be deformed.
We will see on the top a convex deformation, and next to the edges a
concave deformation.
Now we can look at the peak (the middle of the membrane). Here, we can
see the formula that relates the pressure and the displacement of the center
of the membrane.
What do we see in this formula?
• Young’s modulus.
• The thickness of the membrane
• Poisson’s constant
• The radius of the membrane
• The displacement of the center.
Thus, we have a relation between the pressure and the displacement of the
center of the membrane.
Is this relation linear? Not at all, right?
Let’s see what is the situation in the case that relation of the displacement to
the thickness is smaller than 0.1. The displacement is less than 10% of the
thickness of the membrane. In this case, the component on y/t cube will be
negligible and the relation becomes linear!

11
It is also possible to measure the pressure by means of the stress on the
membrane.
We will have a concave deformation at the outer part of the membrane and a
convex deformation towards the middle.
In such a membrante, we will have two types of stress, radial and tangential,
which can be modelled with these formulas.
At the edge, when we have a concave behavior, both will be negative.
Towards the center, where we will have a convex behavior, they will be
positive. This can be seen in the figures.
In this case, we have the stress in function of the pressure, where the
components are very similar and we have r as the variable.
Now, in order to measure these displacements we will want to set some
strain gages in the points in which they get the best sensitivity.
Moreover, we want to place the strain gages in a manner that two of them
are having a positive displacement and the other two a negative one so that
they work properly in the wheatstonebridge.
Let’s look for the maximum negative value looking at the curves. We will
have the maximum negative value in the radial stress at the edges, right?
This means that we will want to set the negative strain gages (1 and 3) in the
radial direction at the edges. They will measure the maximum negative
stress
On the other hand, in the center we should have the same value in terms of
radial or tangential stress. This means we could put them in the radial or the
tangential direction. However, if we place them in the radial direction, they
could overlap with the other gages. Thus, we can put them in the tangential
11
and measure the tangential stress.
Actually, nowadays, there are manufacturers that will create these type
of strain gage foils with the gages placed in the correct directions for
membrane pressure measurement. At the edges, we measure the radial
stress, and two in the middle are measuring the tangential stress. We
can put this foil on top of the membrane with a special adhesive.
Moreover, the manufacture usually gives already output voltage related
to the pressure.
11
Piezoresistive pressure sensor: Concept
+ n-type
- p-type
12
Piezoresistive pressure sensors are mebranesystems where the strain
gages have piezoresistive materials integrated (like semiconductors). This is
an integrated sensor where the diaphragm has the material.
In the second figure we see a clear illustration. We can see the p-types with
the negative gages. This means that if we increase the pressure, the
resistance drops. In the middle, we see the positive gages (n), which
measure the tangential stress. They are 8 of them, which can be put on a
Wheatstone bridge. We will have increasing and decreasing pressure.
12
Piezoresistive pressure sensor: Silicon Micromachined
13
This concept can be integrated in a very nice very simple sensor to measure
pressure with piezoresistive materials with MEMs as we will see next.
13
Optical pressure sensor
•Linear for small (𝑦 ⁄𝑑)for fixed membranes.
(cid:3030)
•Second photodiode is reference.
•Also used as “null balance pressure transducer”
•Totally isolated
14
This is a special sensor used in medical and industrial environments.
We have a membrane, and an input to measure pressure. Moreover, we
have an LED and two photo diodes.
How does it work?
If we have a pressure applied to the membrane, it will move (displace) up
and down.
The higher the membrane rises (higher the pressure), the less light that the
bottom photo diode will detect.
A measurement of the current going through this photodiode will provide a
measurement of the pressure. Maybe even a linear measurement.
Why do we need the upper photodiode?
It will measure all the light coming out of the LED.
Thus, it provides the absolute value to be able to calculate a ratio, i.e., the
relative value. Therefore, we can eliminate any kind of degradation of the
LED source.
In summary:
• It is quite linear for small displacement
• Second photodiode is a reference.
• It can be used as a null balanced pressure transducer
• The most important thing is that they can be made without any copper
wire, they can be isolated. It is also called a full galvanic system. This is
very good for instance for medical purposes. If we want to put a sensor
inside a person’s body. We cannot put anything that has any kind of
copper wire.
14
Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems
We have been discussing from time to time about Micro Electro-Mechanical
Systems (MEMS) because the sensors can be actually integrated in MEMS.
Now that we have had a view at displacement, velocity, accelerometers,
force and pressure sensors, we can have a brief look about what these are.
This is a new technology (10-15 years old) but nowadays a lot of sensors are
made upon this technologies.
15
MEMS Accelerometers
16
Remember from a couple of sessions ago the accelerometer, where we had
the mass, the spring and a displacement sensor. In the figure, the sensor is
a differential capacitor.
The mass is attached to the middle part of the differential capacitor. Thus, if
we have a movement the membrane of the diff capacitor also moves, it
changes the values of the capacitor and that change is linear with the
displacement.
16
MEMS Accelerometer
17
This accelerometer can be implemented into a chip. The capacitor
displacement sensor is very easy to integrate into a MEMs chip. Moreover, it
can use electrostatic forces to bring the mass back to place again.
17
MEMS accelerometer: Shapes and Sizes
• ADXL50, with an overall size of 500 x 625 µm.
• 42 silicon fingers are 100 µm in length with a 2 µm gap and a total capacitance of
0,1 pF.
• As the limiting resolution of the sense amplifier is 20x10-18 pF
• A beam displacement of 20x10-12m can be measured.
18
To give an idea of what type of sizes we are talking about for the
accelerometer.
The overall size is half mmx half mm., where we have 42 silicon fingers.
The displacement is in picometer.
This is a very special chip technology. We need very special techniques. In
IMEC they are specialized in it. These accelerometers are very verycheap
and very verysmall so MEMS can be used for regular activities.

Here you can see a zoomed in microscopic view of this technology where we
can have the mass and the sensors in the lines.

One example of such self-test sensors is the null-balance accelerometer.
A chip where a mass is moving is not very easy. This will need to be done by
means of MEMs.
We can see the mass, we have a displacement sensor, and we have a
spring which is an electric spring (a coil as you can see with a core inside).
Now, if we put a current into a coil by F=Bli, we generate a Force. The higher
the current, the more force I put on the core. And it pushes up or down.
If the acceleration moves up, the mass is pushed down into the coil and the
relative displacement sensor will generate a voltage.
That voltage is used to convert into the current and into the coil. Thus, it
gives a counter Force up. Therefore, my mass will not really change position.
The signal output of the sensor actually will be proportional to the force and
displacement.
Why would these accelerometers be used? What is their benefit? It is a null-
balance accelerometer because the mass is put back to 0 directly after
moving it.
• These sensors can be very verysmall because they have no
displacement (nearly nothing).
• Moreover, they are very good for a self-test:
• Interrupt the connection from the output of the displacement
sensor and the amplifier.
• Put an input voltage to the amplifier (Vi).
• Vi will go to the coil in form of current, a force will be generated and
a displacement will be measured.
• The output of the displacement sensor V0 should be equal to the
input Vi.
21
• This is a very good system that could be used in airbags for
self-testing.
21
MEMS in car industry (2)
22
We can use this in a crash sensor. We could place such sensors in the front
to detect the car crashing with the measurement of the displacement
22
MEMS: 2 axis accelerometers
Second generation 2 axis accelerometer
23
It is also possible to have two axis accelerometers, which will work on the
same way.
23
MEMS: Capacitive accelerometers
24
This is also another type of mems technology with another type of capacitive
sensor. In it, the displacement is angular rather than longitudinal.
24
MEMS: Piezoresistive accelerometers
25
This is an example with piezoresistive materials, as we use in strain gages. If
the mass moves (accelerates) we get an effect on the resistive strain gage.
We would put the strain gage on the four arms. How do we make them
positive and negative? Two of them will be p and the others will be n, as we
saw before also with pressure sensors.
25
MEMS: Vibration sensor
26
This is another interesting example for vibration. The acceleration is
horizontal, with a differential capacitor also horizontal. In this case we can
induce an electrostatic force that could pull the spring to make it less or more
sensitive to the vibration. Thus, it is a variable sensor for the sensitivity and
the range.
26
MEMS: Gyroscopes - Definition
When the sensitive element rotates about a particular fixed-
body axis, which is called sensitive axis, the resulting Coriolis
force causes the proof mass to move in a different mode
27
Gyroscopes measures angular velocity. Here we will have angular velocity
independent on where we are.
What is the working principle? When the sensitive element rotates about a
particular fixed body axis, the Coriolis force causes the proof mass to move
in a different mode.
By having a movement in one direction, a force perpendicular to the direction
appears.
27
MEMS: Gyroscopes – Example 1
sensors mems
28 28
We need a movement, we can do that by vibrating. As long as it is moving
but we are not turning the chip, there is no Coriolis. Capacitors are not
changing. Once we start moving (rotating), we will get Coriolis. As the
movement is oscillating, the output will be also oscillating. The blue angles
are the Coriolis forces perpendicular to the direction of movement.
28
MEMS: Gyroscopes – Example 2
29
This is a tuning fork. When we rotatewe will see the force.

MEMS: Capacitive pressure sensors
30
We have already seen this one today as a pressure sensor.
30
MEMS: Piezoresistive pressure sensor
31
We can also do the same with piezoresistive of the pressure sensors, as we
also just saw
31
MEMS closing
32
MEMS are difficult to build because they are very small and difficult to solder.
Thus, there are manufacturers selling pcbboards with the integrated sensor
to be able to directly use (such a Development Kit).
