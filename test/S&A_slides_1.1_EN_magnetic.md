# SENSORS AND ACTUATORS - Session 1.1: Magnetic Circuits

## Overview
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Motor model
  - Ampere’s Law
  - Current (I), Magnetic Field (B), and Flux Relations
  - Inductance and Faraday’s Law
  - Leakage in Motors

---

## Motor Model
- **Basic Relationships**:
  - Current (I) & Torque (T): \( I \sim T_{em} \)
  - Back-emf (e) & Angular Velocity (ω): \( e \sim ω_{a} \)
  - Power calculations:
    - Electrical Power: \( P_{elec} = V \cdot I \)
    - Mechanical Power: \( P_{mech} = T \cdot ω_{em} \)

- **Components**:
  - **Resistor (Ra)**: Represents voltage loss due to current flow (modeled long wires).
  - **Inductor (La)**: Induces behavior, preventing instantaneous current changes.
  - **Voltage source (ea)**: Represents back-emf generated by motor movement.

- **Key Concept**: 
  - Back-emf allows motor to function similarly to a generator.
  - Ideal operation: Voltage drops in resistors & inductors minimized, maximizing power conversion.

---

## Ampere’s Law
- **Definition**: Indicates that electric currents produce magnetic fields.
- **Formula**: Integrating the magnetic field \( H \) around a closed loop gives: 
  \[
  \oint H \cdot dl = I_{enc}
  \]

- **Right-Hand Rule**: Determines the direction of the magnetic field.

---

## Magnetic Field & Flux Density
- **Equation for Flux Density (B)**:
  \[
  B = μ \cdot H
  \]
  
- **Magnetic Field Intensity \( H \)**:
  \[
  H = \frac{I}{2 \pi r_m}
  \]

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Magnetic Field is proportional to current; disappears with current.
  - Flux density \( B \) is linear until hysteresis occurs.

---

## Magnetic Flux
- **Flux Definition**: 
  \[
  Φ = B \cdot A
  \]

- **Linkage**: 
  \[
  λ = NΦ
  \]

---

## Inductance
- **Inductance Formula**:
  \[
  L = \frac{N^2μA}{l}
  \]

- **Key Points**:
  - Inductance relates flux linkage to current.
  - It interprets the potential voltage generated from changes in current.

---

## Faraday’s Law
- **Voltage Induction**: Changes in flux generate voltages.
  - Lenz’s Law: Induced currents oppose changes in magnetic flux.

- **Formulation**:
  \[
  e(t) = L \frac{di(t)}{dt}
  \]

---

## Leakage and Magnetizing Inductance
- **Leakage Concept**: Not all magnetic flux may pass through the core; some could leak through the air.
- **Circuit Representation**: Leakage represented in motor models as voltage losses.

---

## Conclusions
- The session linked principles of magnetic circuits to motor operation, highlighting resistance, inductance, and inductive effects in motor design and efficiency.
